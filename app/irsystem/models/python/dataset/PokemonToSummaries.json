{"Fletchinder": null, "Seedot": "Unlike its fierce competitors such as Bellsprout, Bulbasaur, and Deerling, Seedot lacks usable offensive stats, a secondary STAB, and even a decent Speed tier, with only Explosion to set it apart from other Chlorophyll attackers. Sun hyper offense teams are also exceedingly rare due to the lack of an auto-setter and the playstyle's rough matchup versus the majority of teams.", "Buneary": "Despite its stiff competition as an offensive Normal-type from Zigzagoon and Bunnelby, Buneary carves itself a unique niche in the LC metagame in its access to Healing Wish and Z-Splash. When using Splash with a Normalium-Z, Buneary is able to gain a +3 boost in its Attack and make great use of its ability to hit 19 Speed to sweep. Furthermore, Buneary has ideal coverage options in Drain Punch, Jump Kick, and the elemental punches to complement its powerful STAB Return, as well as having two unique abilities in Limber and Klutz and an expansive utility movepool consisting of gems in Healing Wish, Thunder Wave, and Heal Bell, providing it with quite a bit of versatility. Unfortunately, Buneary is unable to hold an Eviolite when attempting to sweep and is thus extremely frail and susceptible to priority, especially considering its lack of resistances and weakness to the ever-present Fighting-types like Mienfoo and Timburr. Furthermore, Buneary faces stiff competition from Zigzagoon due to the latter's access to Extreme Speed, is walled by Ghost-type Pokemon if it's running Quick Attack due to its lack of a move to hit them super effectively, and struggles to find setup opportunities due to its frailty. As a result, Buneary requires a lot of support to effectively sweep or support its team. Nevertheless, Buneary packs quite the punch as a Pokemon capable of either supporting its team with Healing Wish or sweeping late-game and definitely deserves consideration as your team's offensive Normal-type.", "Archeops": "Archeops takes one page from lead Aerodactyl and another page from Lycanroc but fails to stand out itself as a Stealth Rock suicide lead. Despite having the unique combination of Head Smash + Endeavor, factors such as Defeatist, a comparatively worse Speed tier than its competition, and dedicated leads being a relatively unimportant role in the metagame prevent Archeops from establishing itself in the NU metagame.", "Mandibuzz": "Rocking an incredible typing and equally impressive 110 / 105 / 95 defensive stats, Mandibuzz is one of the RU tier's most formidable walls. Access to a huge variety of utility moves, such as Knock Off, Taunt, Toxic, U-turn, Brave Bird, Foul Play, and Defog, prevents Mandibuzz from being taken advantage of by walls like Bronzong and setup sweepers like Feraligatr. Mandibuzz's defensive strengths are further bolstered by Overcoat, preventing hail and sandstorm from Pokemon like Vanilluxe and Gigalith from negating its Leftovers; it also prevents Roserade from being able to put it to sleep. Reliable recovery in Roost assures Mandibuzz will stay healthy enough to check Pokemon like Yanmega, Linoone, and Roserade. While 80 Speed is not particularly high, it puts Mandibuzz in a perfect spot; Mandibuzz is faster than the majority of defensive Pokemon, allowing it to act as a great stallbreaker with Taunt and Toxic while remaining slower than a large number of more offensive Pokemon to generate momentum with a slow U-turn. Additionally, Mandibuzz has a favorable matchup against the majority of the defensive Stealth Rock setters in the tier, primarily Bronzong and Registeel, and thus is an incredibly reliable Defog user. However, Mandibuzz's difficulty with fitting Brave Bird onto most of its movesets means it invites in Fighting-types such as Virizion, Bewear, Machamp, and Pangoro that can take advantage of it to set up Swords Dance or fire off strong attacks. Roost removing Mandibuzz's Flying typing also prevents it from checking Pokemon it would otherwise, such as Escavalier and some of the aforementioned Fighting-types.", "Swellow": "Swellow has access to Scrappy Boomburst, and coupled with its incredible Speed and decent Special Attack stat, makes Swellow one of the most troublesome Pokemon for offensive teams to deal with. Additionally, it naturally outspeeds very fast Pokemon such as Virizion, Salazzle, and Noivern, all of which pose an issue to offensive teams. Swellow also has coverage moves that can hit Pokemon that resist Boomburst and U-turn to give it momentum, allowing it to perform well even against defensive teams. However, Swellow is incredibly frail and is almost always 2HKOed if not OHKOed by most neutral hits. Furthermore, being a Flying-type hinders its ability to spam U-turn when Stealth Rock is on the field.", "Eevee": null, "Torracat": null, "Poliwrath": "Poliwrath is a strong option in the PU metagame thanks to its unique defensive typing and ability, which allow it to combat many of the tier's top threats including Jellicent, Aggron, Lycanroc, Omastar, and Skuntank. Aside from extreme role compression, Poliwrath also has a diverse enough movepool to allow it to run a range of offensive and defensive sets as both a physical and special attacker while still managing to keep the aforementioned threats in check. Poliwrath is also one of the few Pokemon with access to moves and abilities such as Circle Throw, Vacuum Wave, and Water Absorb, which are extremely useful for phazing in conjunction with Spikes, revenge killing Omastar, and checking Water-types, respectively. However, Poliwrath's stats are incredibly average, meaning that it can't specialize or excel in any offensive or defensive roles outside of checking the same list of Pokemon. While Poliwrath's typing is extremely good for checking specific Rock- and Water-types, it also leaves Poliwrath vulnerable to a wide range of common Grass-, Flying-, Electric-, and Psychic-types, meaning that almost every team will naturally have multiple Poliwrath checks such as Scyther and Mesprit. Lack of reliable recovery means that Poliwrath must use unreliable means such as Rest or a combination of Leftovers and Protect to avoid being worn down too quickly. Poliwrath also faces some competition from other Fighting- and Water-types such as Gurdurr and Lanturn, but while it will usually be outclassed in terms of raw bulk or strength, its niche is incredibly solid because nothing can compress roles quite like Poliwrath.", "Emolga": "Despite Emolga's unique attributes in an Electric immunity and Encore, its stats outside of Speed are quite lacking, and it is outclassed by mainly Oricorio-E. Emolga also does not hit especially hard, and its quirks do not stand up to Oricorio-E's access to Calm Mind, higher Special Attack, much better bulk, and ability to check threats like Gurdurr and Lilligant much more convincingly.", "Butterfree": "While Butterfree's decent Special Attack and access to Quiver Dance and Tinted Lens are appealing, there's little reason to use it over the otherwise superior Lilligant. Its middling Speed leaves it outsped, even at +1 Speed, by common Choice Scarf users like Togedemaru and Mesprit that can easily dispose of it. Its typing also makes it susceptible to Stealth Rock and common attacking types in Flying and Electric, and its poor bulk makes it almost impossible to successfully set up with Quiver Dance.", "Gliscor": "Gliscor is a versatile Pokemon that can fulfill several roles: it can be a Stealth Rock setter, a Swords Dance sweeper, a Defog user, and even a stallbreaker. Due to its flexibility, Gliscor finds itself on many archetypes in OU, ranging from bulky offense to stall. Gliscor\u2019s amazing defensive typing, good natural bulk, and excellent recovery through Poison Heal and Roost allow it to check prominent Pokemon like Heatran and Toxapex. However, Gliscor faces competition from other Ground-types that have a superior offensive presence, such as Landorus-T and Garchomp. Moreover, its typing also leaves it prone to prominent Pokemon like Greninja, Tapu Bulu, and Mega Latias.", "Wobbuffet": null, "Cresselia": "Cresselia's incredible 120 / 120 / 130 bulk, ability in Levitate, and access to reliable recovery turn it into one of the most threatening defensive Pokemon in the tier, capable of checking devastating Pokemon like Salazzle, Dragalge, and Virizion. A reasonably good base Speed stat of 85 lets Cresselia outpace and OHKO Pokemon like Pangoro with a bit of Speed investment. Its amazing support movepool with options like Thunder Wave, Toxic, and Lunar Dance allows Cresselia to support its teammates well. However, Cresselia is commonly labelled as a \"do-nothing\" Pokemon, and for good reason. Its lackluster Special Attack and lack of any way to beat opposing walls other than Toxic will leave it helpless against other balance staples like Registeel and stallbreaker Mandibuzz. Cresselia's mediocre defensive typing means that it'll only be resisting a couple of attacking types while losing to a plethora of Bug-, Dark-, and Ghost-types. Moonlight's limited PP will quickly leave Cresselia struggling to switch into attackers like Dragalge. Cresselia also has a massive vulnerability to status, notably Toxic poison and paralysis. For example, if Cresselia has been inflicted with Toxic poison, it'll struggle to consistently switch into Pokemon like Shaymin, Salazzle, and Roserade. In the same way, once Cresselia is paralyzed, it will no longer be able to outpace and check Pokemon like Bewear and Pangoro.", "Druddigon": "Druddigon is a special utility Pokemon due its ability to get up Stealth Rock up versus Xatu because of Mold Breaker. Its mono-Dragon typing allows it to resist Water-, Electric-, Grass-, and Fire-type moves, which, when combined with its great bulk, can help it take care of the bigger threats in the tier, such as Magmortar, Incineroar, and Heliolisk. While slow, Druddigon is faster than a number of other Stealth Rock setters such as Steelix and can use Taunt on them to shut them down. However, Druddigon's poor Speed tier, which means it is outrun by a lot of the tier, along with lack of reliable recovery makes it easy to wear down and takes a big toll out of Druddigon, especially when it's not running Leftovers. This mediocre longevity also means that it is forced to rely on teammates like Vaporeon and Audino to remain healthy with Wish support. Even Druddigon's mono-Dragon typing leaves it susceptible to frequent Ice- and Fairy-type moves, which allows top-tier threats such as Sneasel, Mega Glalie, Comfey, and Whimsicott to easily wear it down or KO it. Also, with its mediocre damage output, Druddigon tends to get very passive in the long run.", "Tangela": "Tangela is capable of providing an amazing defensive presence for teams due to its gargantuan physical bulk that is further supplemented by Eviolite, making it one of the most solid blanket checks to physical attackers in the tier, checking Kingler, Primeape, and Lycanroc. It also has many forms of recovery, with Regenerator being by far its most advantageous trait, allowing it to heal off prior damage with greater efficacy with the HP regained upon switching out, helping it remain healthy. Despite its lack of offensive presence, Tangela can pressure opposing teams with its utility moves such as Knock Off, Sleep Powder, and Leech Seed. Although Tangela's Grass typing is great for the purpose of checking physically offensive Water- and Ground-types, this, unfortunately, comes with weaknesses to extremely prevalent attacking types in Ice, Fire, and Flying, leaving it easily threatened by offensive threats such as Pyroar, Aurorus, Eelektross, and Oricorio-G. In addition, Tangela's abysmal Special Defense means that even passive Pokemon with super effective coverage such as Weezing can easily overpower it. Furthermore, it is reliant on Eviolite to function as a blanket check to strong physical attackers, despite its naturally good Defense, and thus is prone to being crippled by certain Pokemon it can be used to deal with, such as Gurdurr and Absol. Tangela also finds itself often competing with Ferroseed and Gourgeist-XL for teams in need of a defensive Grass-type, with the former offering Spikes support and a Steel typing that grants it an immunity to Toxic and the latter being a spinblocker that isn't as bothered by Knock Off. Despite these setbacks, Tangela can be a favorable choice overall for teams in need of a reliable cushion against prominent physical attackers.", "Roggenrola": "Roggenrola might seem appealing as a switch-in to Brave Bird and Flying-types with its high Defense and ability to then force them out after a Weak Armor boost to set up Stealth Rock, but Onix performs the exact same role much more effectively. Other than having a lower Attack stat, Onix has far superior Speed, better defenses, a better movepool, and a Ground-typing that lets it switch in on pivoting Volt Switch users and deal significant damage to Fighting-types with STAB Earthquake. Roggenrola falls flat against any decently fast special attacker and cannot outspeed most Choice Scarf users even after a Weak Armor boost.", "Oricorio": "Oricorio-F at first glance might seem usable, seeing as it's one of the few Fire-types in the tier and it has great STAB moves in Hurricane and Revelation Dance, along with Calm Mind to boost. Unfortunately, using Oricorio-F means giving up using Oricorio-E or Oricorio-G, which have significantly better defensive typing that notably don't cause them to take 50% of their HP from Stealth Rock. It also lacks much in the way of coverage against its checks such as Regirock, and is easily revenge killed by Pokemon such as Lycanroc and Dodrio thanks to its low bulk. This low bulk combined with Oricorio-F's typing also makes it hard to set up with. Even in terms of offensive Fire-types, Combusken, Turtonator, and even Simisear are better options because they have better coverage overall and can still set up like Oricorio-F can.", "Frogadier": null, "Absol": "Absol has a fearsome Attack stat, which in conjunction with Knock Off makes it very hard to switch into. Its good coverage options in Superpower and Play Rough allow it to hit Steel-, Dark-, and Fighting-types like Aggron, Shiftry, Hitmonchan, and Gurdurr. It also has access to Swords Dance to further its wallbreaking potential and Sucker Punch, which makes it a very useful tool against offensive Pokemon and can often be used to sweep after a boost. However, Absol relies greatly on Sucker Punch to outspeed faster Pokemon because of its rather lacking base 75 Speed stat, which can be played around with passive moves like Will-O-Wisp and Substitute from Pokemon like Misdreavus and Oricorio-G. It's also still easily revenge killed by Pokemon like Silvally-Fairy and Alolan Persian, which don't care about Sucker Punch. Due to its lackluster bulk, Absol can easily get KOed throughout the match in general. Finally, Absol sees heavy competition as a Dark-type for a team slot due to the presence of Alolan Raticate and Skuntank; the former has a lot more power behind its moves thanks to Hustle, while the latter provides a lot more utility and is a lot more easy to fit on a team.", "Rowlet": "At first glance, Rowlet seems completely outclassed by Vullaby, as all of the latter's stats are higher than or equal to Rowlet's. Vullaby also gets STAB Knock Off, Weak Armor, and Overcoat, allowing it to be overall better than Rowlet both offensively and defensively. However, Rowlet does have a few niches. To start off, it has access to Baton Pass as well as both Nasty Plot and Swords Dance, allowing it to pass boosts to its teammates when needed. Thanks to its good bulk and access to recovery, it is often able to pass multiple boosts to an ally. It also resists Water and hits Ground-types super effectively with a STAB move, which is unique for a Defog user. Its access to Sucker Punch also means that its offensive set is not as hindered by its low Speed as may seem at first glance and is left less reliant on the opponent's actions than Vullaby. Its Grass / Flying typing allows it to perform as a check to Fighting-types such as Mienfoo as well as Ground-types such as Mudbray and Diglett. Rowlet is also fairly versatile, making it somewhat difficult for your opponent to know what they're up against at Team Preview.", "Azurill": "While Azurill's huge Attack stat and rare typing may seem enticing at first glance, a closer look reveals its biggest flaws: terrible Speed, mediocre bulk, a very shallow movepool, and a lack of Fairy-type STAB moves. After considering these factors, Azurill's niche is almost non-existent due to the existence of Bunnelby, a far more effective offensive Normal-type because of its significantly better Speed tier and coverage options. While Azurill\u2019s very lacking Speed may make it seem like a decent pick on Trick Room teams, there are far better options that are able to set Trick Room themselves or more easily switch into play; in addition, Trick Room is not considered a viable archetype in LC. You're almost always better off running a more reliable Normal-type wallbreaker such as Bunnelby or even Meowth.", "Arceus": null, "Magnemite": "Magnemite is a solid Pokemon in the LC metagame, able to act as a pivot or as a powerful attacker. Its viability stems from its fantastic Special Attack, allowing it to fire off powerful attacks without requiring a boosting item. It is further set apart from other special attackers by its fantastic typing that gives it a plethora of resistances, access to Volt Switch that allows it to serve as a pivot, and access to Sturdy + Berry Juice, allowing it to recover health consistently. However, Magnemite is hindered in the LC metagame by weaknesses to the common Fighting- and Ground-type moves. Additionally, Magnemite only hits 15 Speed, leaving it reliant on a Choice Scarf if it wants to outspeed the metagame or an intact Berry Juice to take hits against offensive teams.", "Sceptile": "Sceptile is an offensive Grass-type with solid power that distinguishes itself from Whimsicott with its powerful STAB moves, strong coverage options, and great Speed. Sceptile is often a problem for offensive teams because of its Speed and great arsenal of moves, which let it easily clean a weakened team late-game. However, Sceptile is very frail, meaning it takes massive damage from any neutral hit and even resisted hits like Rhydon's Earthquake and Heliolisk's Thunderbolt. Despite its great coverage, Sceptile struggles against common Pokemon like Golbat, Vileplume, and bulkier Vikavolt sets that tank its Leaf Storm and aren't hit hard enough by its coverage moves. Unfortunately, Choice Scarf users like Passimian, Braviary, and Accelgor all revenge kill Sceptile. The former two can also grab momentum, since U-turn heavily damages Sceptile. Additionally, priority users like Sneasel and Mega Abomasnow hit Sceptile for a lot of damage with a super effective Ice Shard.", "Linoone": "Linoone has unique access to Belly Drum and Extreme Speed, making up for its mediocre Attack stat and allowing it to OHKO most of the tier after a Belly Drum. Gluttony in tandem with Figy Berry allows Linoone to recover half of its HP, allowing it to set up virtually always if it endures a hit. It also has access to useful coverage options such as Stomping Tantrum, Seed Bomb, and Throat Chop, enabling it to hit most of the Rock-, Steel-, and Ghost-types in the tier. Linoone also has a decent Speed stat, outspeeding most Pokemon in the tier without maximum investments. However, its mediocre bulk makes it harder for Linoone to set up against most offensive teams without dual screens or Memento support. Even at +6, Linoone has some problems breaking the bulkiest Pokemon in the tier such as Escavalier and Bronzong, and it's not able to cover the entire tier with only 3 attacks. It's usually deadweight against stall teams, since it can't break some bulky Pokemon and loses to Quagsire.", "Lillipup": "Lillipup possesses literally no defining features that set it apart from any other pure Normal-type Little Cup has to offer. Bunnelby outclasses Lillipup offensively with Huge Power and its access to Earthquake to hit Rock- and Steel-types such as Tirtouga and Pawniard, while Meowth outshines Lillipup due to its Speed, strong priority moves, and ability to pivot with U-turn. Furthermore, Munchlax outclasses Lillipup as bulky Normal-type due to the latter's barren movepool and average-at-best bulk.", "Cleffa": "Cleffa is a horrendous Pokemon that struggles to establish a useful niche for itself due to its shallow movepool, terrible stats, and lack of any STAB move. Its rare access to Magic Guard means Cleffa can at least run a Counter set, allowing it to be a catch-all stop, although it is easy to circumvent and completely unreliable. You're better off running Focus Sash Abra or any SturdyJuice Pokemon, like Magnemite or Onix, all of which actually have an offensive presence and can fulfill the same niche Cleffa attempts.", "Lapras": "Lapras has a small niche in the PU metagame thanks to its decent power with Choice Specs, which allows it to serve as a wallbreaker. In addition, Water Absorb coupled with Freeze-Dry and good bulk allows Lapras to pressure a myriad of Water-type Pokemon such as Gastrodon, Lanturn, and Swanna. Lapras also sports a solid offensive typing that allows it to hit a wide array of offensive Pokemon with its powerful STAB attacks. On the downside, Lapras's typing leaves it weak to common Electric-, Grass-, and Fighting-type Pokemon such as Abomasnow, Eelektross, and Hitmonchan. Lapras is also vulnerable to all entry hazards, which make it easily worn down over the course of a match. Furthermore, Lapras's lackluster base 60 Speed stat puts it below a wide variety of threats including Lycanroc, Alolan Raichu, and Primeape, meaning it is easily revenge killed. Finally, even when Lapras is wielding Choice Specs, bulky Pokemon such as Clefairy are able to switch into and tank its STAB attacks with ease. Because of this, Lapras is outclassed by other Water- and Ice-types such as Ludicolo and Aurorus, which have higher Special Attack stats that allow them to 2HKO special walls more easily than Lapras.", "Bronzor": "Thanks to huge defensive stats complemented by a good defensive typing and a great ability in Levitate, Bronzor is a decent defensive Stealth Rock setter. With reliable recovery in Berry Juice + Recycle, it is usually able to set it up multiple times over the course of a match. Levitate is an awesome ability for Bronzor, as it removes its weakness to Ground-type moves and means it can't be trapped by Diglett. Its typing also allows it to check hail teams, certain Abra sets, Shellder, and Rufflet. However, Bronzor suffers from a huge weakness to Knock Off, which not only does tremendous damage to it, but also removes its only means of recovery in Berry Juice. This weakness means it can't check Fighting-types as well as it otherwise could, since they usually carry the move. Bronzor also has low offensive stats, meaning it can often be setup bait and is unable to threaten the Pokemon it checks. Lastly, it has a bad matchup against common spinners like Staryu and Drilbur as well as a common Defogger in Vullaby, meaning it has a hard time keeping Stealth Rock up.", "Krookodile": "With the ability to fulfill many roles, Krookodile is a big threat in the UnderUsed metagame and is capable of fitting onto multiple team archetypes. Its great typing gives it excellent coverage between its STAB attacks as well as key immunities to Psychic- and Electric-type attacks and four helpful resistances. Its Intimidate ability further solidifies its defensive capabilities and allows it to function as a capable Stealth Rock setter. Krookodile also excels as one of the tier's best Choice Scarf users thanks to its ability to revenge kill several foes quite easily as well as take advantage of the switches it forces with STAB Pursuit. However, Krookodile's typing provides with as many useful resistances as common weaknesses, most notably to Fairy-, Water-, and Fighting-type attacks. Krookodile can also be hindered at times by its Speed tier, which, while not bad, leaves it outsped by several offensive Pokemon, including Kyurem, Mega Pidgeot, and Infernape. Lastly, Krookodile is also hurt by its only average damage output, which prevents it from breaking past especially bulky foes like Hippowdon, Suicune, and Alomomola.", "Mankey": "Mankey is a revenge killer whose main niche over other Fighting-types is its access to Gunk Shot, which allows it to significantly damage Fairy-types, and Close Combat, which is one of the strongest Fighting-type moves. It also has other coverage moves such as Earthquake to hit Poison-types and Ice Punch to hit Foongus and Pumpkaboo, and a pivoting tool in U-turn, allowing Mankey to gain momentum, all of which are backed up by a great Attack stat and the respectable 17 Speed tier. Thanks to Defiant, it is also able to gain +2 Attack whenever it is affected by Sticky Web, Defog, or Intimidate. However, Mankey cannot take hits and is vulnerable to priority attacks due to its poor bulk, which is only amplified after Close Combat's defense drops. It faces heavy competition from other Fighting-types, primarily Mienfoo, as it is able to perform Mankey's role of a revenge killer far more consistently. In addition, Mankey's lack of Knock Off means that it has a tough time getting past Ghost-types, and while Defiant is a good ability, it is very situational and hard to make use of with Mankey's low bulk.", "Mawile": "Mega Mawile is one of the strongest breakers in the OU metagame. Solid coverage options like Knock Off, Ice Punch, Fire Fang, and Thunder Punch alongside a setup move in Swords Dance make Mega Mawile impossible to deal with defensively, while its access to Sucker Punch gives it the ability to threaten offensive teams. Its typing, combined with Intimidate, grants it many opportunities to either set up or just attack against common Pokemon such as Clefable, Tapu Bulu, and Reuniclus, allowing it to punch holes in teams relatively consistently. However, because of its very poor Speed, Mega Mawile heavily relies on Sucker Punch to deal with faster threats, which allows Pokemon like Tapu Koko, Tapu Lele, and Ash-Greninja to revenge kill it relatively consistently; hence, it struggles more against offensive teams that can overwhelm it before it can get a strong hit off. While Mega Mawile's typing is great, it does give Mega Mawile two weaknesses to extremely common types, namely Ground and Fire, making it vulnerable to common Pokemon such as Heatran, Landorus-T, and Garchomp, which are also bulky enough to take a +2 Sucker Punch. Finally, Mega Mawile has slight issues with picking correct coverage, as it can't always run what it wants.", "Gothorita": null, "Palkia": null, "Raticate": "Even if Raticate's nice Speed, decent Attack, and access to Guts all seem like reasons to use it, it is sadly outclassed by Normal-type wallbreakers such as Kangaskhan, Stoutland, Alolan Raticate, and Zangoose. Its mediocre bulk and typing leave it susceptible to Mach Punch, one of the most common priority moves in the tier, as well as faster attackers. It also often lacks the firepower to break through walls like Regirock and Jellicent.", "Snubbull": "Thanks to its Fairy typing and Intimidate, Snubbull acts as a reliable check to many metagame-defining Pokemon, including Mienfoo, Timburr, and Vullaby, and as a soft check to a slew of physical attackers. Numerous support options, including Heal Bell, Thief, and Thunder Wave, let Snubbull adequately support its team, and its good Attack, fantastic coverage options, and access to Bulk Up make it an immediate threat, generally outperforming other Fairy-types, most notably Spritzee, on offensive teams as a result. Although drawbacks in low Speed and a lack of built-in recovery mean that it is easily forced out and worn down, its coveted niche as an offensive Fighting-type check ensures that it remains one of the most splashable Pokemon in the metagame.", "Sharpedo": "Mega Sharpedo is a great late-game cleaner, utilizing both its pre-Mega ability in Speed Boost and its post-Mega ability in Strong Jaw to sweep. Its great Attack and Speed stats allow Mega Sharpedo to hit very hard and very fast at the same time, with Crunch severely damaging Pokemon such as Scizor and Mamoswine. Strong Jaw also boosts the Base Power of coverage moves like Ice Fang and Psychic Fangs, allowing Mega Sharpedo to hit would-be checks and counters, such as Mega Altaria, Kommo-o, Heracross, and Hydreigon, very hard. Mega Sharpedo has terrible bulk and a defensive typing that gives it numerous weaknesses to common types like Fighting, Grass, and Bug, although it does resist a very important priority move in Bullet Punch. Said poor bulk means that if Mega Sharpedo doesn't OHKO what's in front of it, it will likely get OHKOed in return. It also faces great competition from other Mega Evolutions like Mega Aerodactyl and Mega Altaria, both of which also have greater defensive utility and wider movepools. Finally, Mega Sharpedo struggles to break through bulky walls like Mega Aggron and Swampert without them being significantly weakened beforehand, which can stop a late-game sweep in its tracks. It also struggles to sweep without entry hazard support.", "Houndour": "Houndour is one of LC's premier wallbreakers with a STAB combination resisted only by the frail Carvanha, opposing Houndour, and the largely unviable Deino. As a result, only a handful of Pokemon are able to switch into Houndour and even less can manage to more than once. STAB Sucker Punch helps Houndour fend off quicker foes as well, helping to augment its only okay Speed. Houndour's typing is quite lackluster defensively, however, as not only is Houndour weak to the ever-common Fighting-, Water-, and Ground-types in the tier, but it is also frail. This means Houndour is frequently forced out if it cannot KO what is in front of it, which is particularly bad because Houndour is weak to Stealth Rock. It also suffers from being weak to Mach Punch, Aqua Jet, and Vacuum Wave, all quite common priority moves.", "Stoutland": "Stoutland stands out as an amazing wallbreaker thanks to an excellent base 110 Attack and access to Scrappy, which allows Stoutland to more easily spam Return. Its decent bulk allows it to switch in on Pokemon such as defensive Jellicent and Roselia, which also allows it to take a hit from faster foes. Although it has a decent Speed for a wallbreaker, it's still not too hard to revenge kill or be outright outsped. It also has trouble with Fighting-, Steel-, and Rock-types and gets a lot of competition from other Normal-types such as Kangaskhan and Zangoose; however, Stoutland stands out from them due to its large damage output without fear of Double-Edge recoil or being put on a timer through Toxic poison.", "Vikavolt": "A Bug / Electric typing combined with the ability Levitate means that Vikavolt can come in against many NU staples such as Steelix and Passimian easily, as well as taking little from NU's Grass-type wallbreakers such as Sceptile. Furthermore, an extremely high base 145 Special Attack and Electric-, Bug-, and Grass-type coverage means that any team lacking a dedicated special wall will struggle to safely switch into Vikavolt. Despite only having base 43 Speed, Vikavolt is still fast enough to outspeed many of NU's walls, including some base 50s such as Vileplume as well as Vaporeon with Speed investment if needed. This low Speed also gives Vikavolt a slow Volt Switch, which can help to get teammates in without them taking damage. However, while its Bug / Electric typing is very unique defensively, it leaves Vikavolt with a weakness to Stealth Rock, so it is easily worn down from repeatedly using Volt Switch as well as easily hit for heavy damage from Rock- and Fire-type attacks.", "Lurantis": "Lurantis is a good utility choice for teams with its decent defensive typing, good support options, access to the ability Contrary, access to recovery, and most importantly access to Defog. A pure Grass typing and decent mixed defenses make Lurantis a sought-after switch-in for attacking types such as Ground, Electric, and Water while also giving it good matchups against many Stealth Rock setters such as Regirock. Additionally, access to Defog gives Lurantis the ability to remove entry hazards from the playing field for its teammates. On top of all of that, Lurantis is not as passive as some other Defog users, as it has a strong STAB option in the form of Leaf Storm and the ability to raise its Special Attack through Contrary. However, Lurantis faces strong competition from other hazard removers such as Skuntank and Hitmonchan, which generally have more utility, such as priority or simply the ability to absorb Toxic Spikes, and are immediately more threatening by being more powerful and faster. Lurantis also struggles with weaknesses to common attacking types, such as Fire and Flying from threats like Pyroar and Oricorio-G, reliance on low-PP moves like Leaf Storm and Synthesis, and susceptibility to residual damage from the hazards it is trying to remove, especially Toxic Spikes.", "Aggron": "Aggron sees considerable improvements in multiple key areas upon Mega Evolution, making it a solid pick in the UU metagame. Most notably, its Defense stat boosts to a gargantuan base 230, pairing nicely with its solid defensive typing in Steel and making it a strong answer to Pokemon like Mega Aerodactyl and Dragon Dance Mega Altaria. Filter makes for a fantastic ability, helping it against super effective attackers like Krookodile and Cobalion. Even uninvested, Mega Aggron's base 140 Attack stat gives it respectable offensive presence for a more bulk-oriented Pokemon, especially when combined with its naturally powerful Heavy Slam and nice coverage options in Earthquake and Fire Punch. However, its HP and Special Defense stats are rather mediocre, limiting its overall effectiveness as a tank. Additionally, Mega Aggron has no passive or reliable recovery, making it easily worn down over the course of a match. Mega Steelix also poses stiff competition as a Steel-type Stealth Rock user due to its similar stats and immunity to Electric, though Mega Aggron does possess a better ability in Filter and a generally more useful defensive typing. Lastly, Mega Aggron faces poor one-on-one matchups against some Defog users such as Gligar, Moltres, Rotom-H, and Hydreigon, which can pose formidable obstacles to keeping up Stealth Rock.", "Slowbro": "Slowbro's excellent defensive typing and great defensive stats allow it to pivot into and check several key offensive Pokemon, such as Zygarde-10% and Tyrantrum. Its resistance to Fighting-type moves is particularly noteworthy, letting it switch into various threats such as Medicham, Toxicroak, and Bewear with ease. Slowbro's exceptional longevity, due to the combination of Regenerator and Slack Off, ensures it will be able to pivot into physical attackers throughout the whole match. Unfortunately, Slowbro faces stiff competition from the other amazing Water- and Psychic-types in the tier, such as Milotic, Mantine, and Cresselia, although unlike them, it is able to avoid passivity issues due to its decent Special Attack combined with a good offensive movepool. Although its typing blesses it with important resistances, it is also cursed with multiple weaknesses to common offensive typings like Grass, Dark, and Electric. This makes Slowbro weak to powerful threats like Shaymin, Mega Blastoise, Drapion, and Raikou. Slowbro's Psychic typing also leaves it a vulnerable target in such a Pursuit-heavy metagame. Although its high Defense and Regenerator mitigate this issue, it can get chipped for big damage or removed from the game entirely by trappers such as Drapion and Escavalier. Slowbro is unable to dent most Water-types like Milotic and Mega Blastoise unless running the niche Grass Knot or Toxic. Its mediocre Special Defense stat leaves it unable to wall specially offensive threats such as Noivern and Nidoqueen.", "Slakoth": null, "Celebi": "Thanks to its diverse movepool and solid stats across the board, Celebi is a potent and versatile threat in the UU metagame. It can utilize its decent offensive typing to function as a competent sweeper and stallbreaker with Nasty Plot, forcing out the tier's several popular Ground- and Water-types in order to set up. Thanks to its diverse movepool, it can also work around conventional Grass-type checks through the use of coverage options like Earth Power and Dazzling Gleam, which lure in Steel-types and Dragon-types respectively. Celebi can also viably run a defensive Stealth Rock set due to its expansive support movepool, its decent bulk with investment, and a typing that provides it with the ability to act as a strong defensive pivot that can switch into attacks such as Scald and Earthquake. Its Natural Cure ability is also a relatively useful tool, allowing it to come in on Pokemon that commonly carry status-inducing moves, such as Alomomola and Hippowdon, without fear of a long-term status ailment. Unfortunately, Celebi's defensive typing provides it with as many crippling weaknesses as useful resistances, burdening it with vulnerabilities to several top threats, including Infernape, Scizor, and Hydreigon. Celebi also suffers from its relatively average Speed tier, which leaves it outsped and heavily threatened by the likes of Gengar, Nihilego, and Infernape.", "Ampharos": "Thanks to its Electric / Dragon typing, Mega Ampharos is able to check a unique set of Pokemon, such as Milotic, Noivern, Roserade without Sludge Bomb, and Raikou. An impressively high Special Attack stat and respectable bulk for an attacker allow Mega Ampharos to support its team by bringing in frailer Pokemon with a slow Volt Switch that packs a punch. Mold Breaker provides Mega Ampharos with quirky capabilities such as threatening to OHKO Rhyperior with Focus Blast and Volt Switching out of Pokemon with Volt Absorb such as Jolteon. However, Mega Ampharos is very slow for an attacker even after an Agility boost; if it is switching into an attack, it will have to be able to tank a second one should it wish to hit back. Mega Ampharos doesn't share a lot of traits with the other Electric-types in the tier, and as such, it doesn't face competition from them for a team slot; it sadly instead competes with both the other powerful Mega Evolutions in the tier, namely Mega Blastoise and Mega Abomasnow, and other slow bulky wallbreakers with similar resistances, such as Araquanid, Escavalier, and Dragalge. Even though Mega Ampharos sports an impressive number of resistances, it is weak to very common attacking types such as Ground and Ice, which means it fears STAB and coverage moves from the likes of Flygon, Zygarde-10%, Mega Blastoise, Nidoqueen, Mega Glalie, and Mega Abomasnow. Although Mega Ampharos gains considerable bulk post-Mega Evolution, having to spend a turn Mega Evolving is troublesome when, pre-Mega Evolution, it has very few resistances and significantly less bulk to come in on an attack.", "Omastar": "Omastar's toolkit has great variety both offensively and defensively, letting it perform the role of a threatening setup sweeper with Shell Smash or of a utility entry hazard setter with access to Stealth Rock, Spikes, and Toxic Spikes. Omastar's phenomenal Special Attack stat, coverage options with moves like Ice Beam and Earth Power, and great use of Z-Moves give it both immediate offensive presence and ways of dealing with checks such as Lanturn, Jynx, and Poliwrath. Its flexibility also lies in its abilities, as offensive sets appreciate Weak Armor and Swift Swim creating advantageous positions, while Shell Armor is great for securing its durability defensively. With a large Defense stat and a solid Rock / Water typing, Omastar can find opportunities to set up Shell Smash or hazards on many offensive and defensive Pokemon alike. That same typing and Defense also allow it to act as an effective physical wall capable of checking a variety of threats including Skuntank, Scyther, and Stoutland. However, despite its great offensive presence, Omastar's low Speed inhibits its ability to threaten faster Pokemon like Mesprit and Pyroar before setting up. This flaw also means that even after a boost, it is susceptible to popular Choice Scarf users such as Togedemaru and Primeape. For all its advantages with its typing, it suffers from weaknesses to several common types, notably a severe weakness to Grass, which leaves it pressured by STAB or coverage moves from Pokemon like Lilligant and Floatzel. Its Fighting weakness leaves it susceptible to common priority users such as Hitmonchan, Gurdurr, and Poliwrath, while its Electric weakness leaves it vulnerable to Pokemon like Lanturn and Manectric. Its low Special Defense not only worsens this issue against these Grass- and Electric-type Pokemon but also limits Omastar's setup opportunities to situational circumstances like against Choice Specs Froslass locked into Ice Beam.", "Nidoran-F": "Although it has access to Toxic Spikes, Nidoran-F is entirely outclassed as a defensive Toxic Spikes setter by Mareanie and Koffing, which boast better bulk. Other Poison-type Pokemon such as Foongus and Grimer-Alola also outclass it defensively and offensively as well. As such, Nidoran-F is bad and shouldn't be used.", "Binacle": "Although Binacle has access to one of the best boosting moves in the game in Shell Smash, a nice ability in Tough Claws, and good coverage moves like Cross Chop, it finds itself outclassed by other Shell Smash users in the metagame due to its terribly distributed base stats. No matter how good hitting Ferroseed with Cross Chop is, these poor base stats cause it to be outclassed by Pokemon such as Tirtouga, which shares the same exact typing but has more tools like Sturdy and Aqua Jet, and Shellder, which has Skill Link to optimize the use of multi-hit moves like Icicle Spear and Rock Blast.", "Zorua": "Zorua's signature ability Illusion gives it a decent and unique niche in Little Cup. Zorua's main function is to trick opponents into thinking they're using super effective moves when really they are merely attacking a disguised Zorua. Its relatively high Attack and Special Attack stats help Zorua score a surprise KO. It also has a great Speed tier at 17, Speed tying with Snivy, Drilbur, and Mienfoo. Zorua has access to some great moves, such as U-turn, STAB Knock Off, and Nasty Plot. However, Zorua's paper-thin defenses and relatively poor defensive typing leave it vulnerable to priority and any super effective moves aimed its way. Its fairly narrow movepool also leaves it completely walled by common Fairy-types, namely Spritzee and Snubbull. Finally, Zorua has a weakness to the common Fighting-types and U-turn users of Little Cup.", "Ledian": "\"Falcon... PUNCH\" is what Ledian cheers to itself in the lonely, unranked depths of PU, because it's a god-awful Pokemon with no niche.", "Nidoran-M": "While Nidoran-M may look worthwhile due to Hustle boosting its attack, it suffers from a terrible Speed stat, poor defenses, and a horrible offensive typing. Even with its high Attack, Nidoran-M is unable to break through a majority of walls without extensive setups and is heavily reliant on Sucker Punch to hit faster targets, which is easily exploitable by the bevy of faster Fighting- and Dark-types in the tier. Because of this, other, stronger wallbreakers such as Croagunk, Rufflet, and Pawniard are much more useful, as they have much better speed, bulk, and STAB attacks to allow them to to break through opposing teams.", "Walrein": "Walrein could fulfill the role of a special wall thanks to its decent bulk. However, it's outclassed by Regice and Assault Vest users like Lanturn and Hitmonchan. Walrein has an okay support movepool, but despite this, it is very slow and has almost no offensive moves to back it up, making it a very passive Pokemon. Despite working best as a decent Ice-type check, it is weak to Stealth Rock and many offensive threats like Kabutops, Lycanroc, and Lilligant are able to deal a lot of damage to it. This, along with a lack of reliable recovery, makes Walrein much frailer than what one would expect.", "Basculin": "Basculin's access to Adaptability and good Speed tier give it a slight niche as a physical Water-type that can more easily break through more physical walls like Mesprit and Weezing and revenge kill targets with Aqua Jet than other physical Water-types. However, Basculin's wallbreaking capabilities are limited due to its poor movepool causing it to struggle against teams with more defined Water-type answers and its only decent Attack stat preventing it from reliably sweeping and making its coverage less powerful. Because its base Attack stat is not the greatest, its coverage moves don't deal the best damage, and Basculin is overreliant on Adaptability. Along with susceptibility to all entry hazards, Basculin's poor bulk is not doing it any favors and makes it vulnerable to being knocked out by priority moves such as Sucker Punch and Mach Punch. While Basculin's Speed is good, it sits at that uncertain point where it is fast but not fast enough to outspeed everything that it wants to, such as Lycanroc and Dodrio. It also faces competition from its Water-type brethren such as Floatzel and Carracosta, which can hit harder and have access to Shell Smash, respectively.", "Eelektrik": null, "Durant": "Durant is a hard-hitting, niche sweeper in the UU metagame and is able to hit harder than Scizor due to Hustle. While Hustle's accuracy drop can cost matches, particularly with moves like Rock Slide having nearly 70% accuracy, it can be remedied with Hone Claws or bypassed through the use of a Z-Move. Durant's nice Speed tier lets it outrun and pressure most of the Fighting-types in the tier, including Cobalion, Terrakion, and Infernape lacking a Choice Scarf, and its higher Speed tier and unique coverage enable it to beat Pokemon Scizor can't, such as Moltres, Chandelure, and Rotom-H. However, the combination of Hustle's unreliability and Durant's fragility ultimately makes Durant subpar when compared to Scizor, which boasts better bulk, can take better advantage of its typing, and can apply more pressure with its priority moves. Durant can be blown back by all the faster special attackers in tier, such as Gengar, Latias, and Starmie, due to its poor Special Defense stat despite having one of the best defensive typings in the game. With Scizor being a top-tier threat, measures normally taken for Scizor on opposing teams, such as Fire Punch Mega Aggron and Babiri Berry Togekiss, can make Durant's job harder.", "Tapu Bulu": "Tapu Bulu is capable of checking prominent threats in the OU tier like Gliscor, Ash-Greninja, Tapu Koko, and Mega Alakazam thanks to its typing and well-rounded bulk. Solid recovery options in Synthesis, Horn Leech, and Grassy Terrain make Tapu Bulu incredibly hard to wear down. Grassy Surge offers vital team support by powering up Grass-type attacks, weakening Ground-type moves, and providing grounded Pokemon with passive recovery. Tapu Bulu's incredibly strong Grass-type moves turn it into a devastating wallbreaker capable of breaking through many Grass-resistant foes such as Tornadus-T and Zapdos. However, Tapu Bulu's middling Speed tier leaves a lot to be desired, as it is outsped by threatening Pokemon like Heatran and Hoopa-U. Furthermore, the popularity of Steel-types that aren't weak to Superpower such as Celesteela and Mega Scizor as well as defensive Grass-types like Tangrowth and Mega Venusaur hurt Tapu Bulu's offensive capabilities.", "Swirlix": null, "Araquanid": "Araquanid's devastatingly powerful Water Bubble-boosted STAB attacks, great special bulk and decent resistances that give it switch-in opportunities versus foes like Mega Blastoise, Nidoqueen, and weak support Pokemon, and ability to trap and remove some of its own checks with Spider Web all contribute to it being a notable threat in the tier. The immunity to burn that Water Bubble grants is very useful for a physical attacker, meaning Araquanid can take advantage of Scald users instead of the other way around. However, Araquanid is slow and physically frail, so it is susceptible to faster physical attackers. Araquanid also has a very shallow movepool, and what few good coverage moves it does have access to are undermined by its underwhelming power outside of Water-type moves. Araquanid also has no reliable recovery, which, alongside a weakness to Stealth Rock, causes it to be whittled easily.", "Huntail": "Huntail faces competition from other Shell Smash users in PU; Omastar and Gorebyss have access to stronger Special Attack stats and STAB moves, while Carracosta has better bulk with access to a reliable priority attack in Aqua Jet. However, Huntail's primary niche that sets it apart from the aforementioned Shell Smash users is access to Sucker Punch, which allows it to pick off faster Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Manectric. Additionally, Huntail outshines its fellow Water-types in terms of having a higher base Speed stat than Carracosta, an immunity to being burned, meaning Pokemon such as Weezing from crippling with Will-O-Wisp, and finally the ability to run mixed sets with Ice Beam, which can lure in bulky Grass-types such as Tangela and take them out. On the downside, finding setup opportunities with Huntail is difficult because it has mediocre bulk and doesn't have access to Solid Rock. Additionally, being susceptible to all form of entry hazards means that Huntail has to be preserved for late-game, since it gets worn down easily, making setup opportunities even more difficult. Also, unfortunately, even after a +2 Speed boost from Shell Smash, Huntail is easily revenge killed by faster foes such as Choice Scarf Primeape and Rotom-F, which take a +2 Sucker Punch. Furthermore, despite having Ice Beam, Huntail struggles at breaking through other Grass-type Pokemon like Ferroseed and Abomasnow. Huntail also has trouble getting past bulky Water-types, like Gastrodon, which can wall it and thus prevent a sweep. Lastly, with Kangaskhan, Skuntank, and Hitmonchan being so prevalent, vulnerability to priority is also an issue for Huntail.", "Cosmog": null, "Ambipom": "Ambipom's niche is in its access to STAB- and Technician-boosted Fake Out, which allows it to pressure most offensive teams with a relatively strong priority move. Furthermore, U-turn coupled with decent offensive stats allows Ambipom to act as an offensive pivot. However, STAB priority is much better on Pokemon such as Sneasel, Comfey, and Decidueye because not only do their priority moves provide stronger offensive coverage, they can also be used more than once after they enter battle. While Ambipom may be fast and decently strong, it cannot take a hit thanks to its poor bulk, and it has mediocre firepower due to being reliant on its Normal STAB moves for damage, rather than super effective coverage, which makes it difficult for Ambipom to even dent the top defensive cores in NeverUsed, which is why it is outclassed as an all-out offensive pivot by Pokemon such as Passimian, Heliolisk, Rotom, and Whimsicott. Ambipom is also very easy to wear down because it is vulnerable to all entry hazards, status conditions, and the recoil from Life Orb. All of these flaws make Ambipom a very poor choice to put on a team in the current NeverUsed environment.", "Piloswine": "Piloswine is a solid Pokemon in NU due to its access to Stealth Rock and its powerful STAB combination, which allows it to simultaneously threaten most other Stealth Rock users, Rapid Spin users, Defog users, and Xatu, the sole NU Pokemon with Magic Bounce. On top of this, Piloswine is immune to Volt Switch, which combined with its bulk makes it a great offensive check to Electric-types. Thick Fat allows Piloswine to be one of the most reliable switch-ins to opposing Ice-types in NU. Piloswine is quite slow and has a poor matchup against common Pokemon such as Passimian and defensive Slowking.", "Rufflet": "Rufflet was a mediocre Pokemon in XY, but SM gave it access to Brave Bird, cementing its place as a fearsome threat. Rufflet is able to hit incredibly hard because of its ability Hustle, which raises its Attack stat by 1.5. However, the downside to this ability is that all of Rufflet's physical moves except for Aerial Ace have only an 80% hit rate. Rufflet's good bulk and ways to get around traditional Flying-type counters with Superpower allow it to run good Choice Scarf and Bulk Up sets, although its mediocre Speed tier makes it unable to outspeed faster threats like Mienfoo, Chinchou, and Onix.", "Gabite": null, "Pansear": "Pansear is almost completely outclassed by other Fire-types in LC such as Ponyta due to its mediocre stats, poor abilities, and unimpressive offensive movepool. However, Pansear is capable of running a serviceable Will-O-Wisp stalling set to take on and defeat many physical attackers in LC, though this is a rather slow strategy and quite vulnerable to many special attackers and opposing Fire-types. Generally, teams should use Ponyta for offensive Fire-type needs and burn spreading utility.", "Doduo": "Doduo's excellent Attack stat, powerful STAB moves, and good coverage options make it one of the best physical attackers in the LC metagame. It typically takes on the role of a powerful wallbreaker, using its very good Speed stat and coverage options to wear down opposing teams or to end games against slower teams. It is helped in its wallbreaking by its coverage options, which make it impossible to safely switch into. Doduo can also flip its wallbreaking set on its head and run a Choice Scarf set, which outspeeds most of the Pokemon that typically revenge kill it and can reliably clean up weakened teams late-game. However, Doduo suffers from poor defensive stats that leave it vulnerable to revenge killing and priority attacks. Furthermore, its most powerful and spammable move, Brave Bird, has significant recoil damage, which, coupled with its Stealth Rock weakness, means it tends to get worn down very fast.", "Rotom": "Rotom is a fairly versatile Pokemon, capable of serving as a bulky Defog user, an offensive pivot that can easily wear teams down with Volt Switch and Hex, or a Choice Scarf user that can revenge kill offensive threats like Aerodactyl and +1 Vivillon. Levitate and an Electric / Ghost typing give Rotom a good number of resistances and immunities that includes Flying, Electric, Steel, Fighting, Normal, and Ground, enabling it to check important threats such as Passimian, Braviary, and Klinklang. Rotom has access to a solid support movepool with options like Will-O-Wisp, Trick, and Defog. Defog is especially notable given that Rotom's immunity to all entry hazards besides Stealth Rock and ability to threaten most hazard setters with Will-O-Wisp + Hex give it an easier time removing hazards. Volt Switch also gives Rotom the ability to pivot out against counters like Guzzlord as well as generate momentum for its team and give deadly wallbreakers an easier time switching in, and few Ground-types can reliably switch into Volt Switch thanks to the threat of being burned by Will-O-Wisp. However, Rotom's defensive capabilities are hindered by its average bulk, reliance on Iapapa Berry for recovery, and vulnerability to Dark, a very common offensive typing. Choice Scarf Rotom doesn't appreciate how easy its STAB moves are to exploit, whereas non-Choice Scarf variants don't appreciate being outpaced by common offensive Pokemon such as Sceptile and Sneasel. Even with Special Attack investment, Rotom isn't very powerful on its own and is often reliant on Z-Moves to deal with bulkier foes like pivot Incineroar, meaning that it can struggle with consistently breaking through teams.", "Pansage": null, "Crawdaunt": "Crawdaunt has excellent wallbreaking potential due to its stellar base 120 Attack stat as well as Adaptability to double the power of its STAB moves. Additionally, its access to Swords Dance and high-Base Power moves such as Crabhammer and Knock Off leaves it with little defensive counterplay. Aqua Jet also gives it the ability to pick off frailer revenge killers such as Mienshao and Mega Beedrill. In addition to its proficiency with Swords Dance, Crawdaunt can also function as a deadly Choice Band wallbreaker that more immediately threatens opposing teams. However, due to poor defenses and significantly below average Speed, Crawdaunt is hard pressed to find wallbreaking opportunities. Offensive threats such as Mega Manectric, Celebi, and Cobalion can often revenge kill it, and its weaknesses to pivoting moves in Volt Switch and U-turn can give opposing teams momentum. Finally, it faces competition from other wallbreakers such as Primarina and Infernape, which are easier to fit on teams and provide more utility.", "Crobat": "Crobat's useful typing provides it with notable resistances and an immunity, enabling it to check UU staples like Kommo-o and Mega Altaria efficiently. A high Speed stat allows Crobat to outspeed and weaken several of UU's key threats, enabling it to utilize its STAB moves to KO slower threats such as Heracross and Hippowdon or cripple them with Taunt. This also allows Crobat to act as an effective revenge killer for Pokemon like Gengar, Terrakion, and Infernape. Crobat's access to a variety of utility moves such as U-turn, Taunt, Super Fang, and Defog makes it a prominent support Pokemon in the UU metagame. However, its typing leaves it vulnerable to other common threats such as Nihilego, Mega Manectric, and Mega Aerodactyl, with the latter two outspeeding and OHKOing Crobat. Its use as a pivot is somewhat neutered by its weakness to Stealth Rock, limiting the number of times it can come in to perform its utility role without either being KOed or forced to use Roost. Despite access to a strong STAB move in Brave Bird, Crobat struggles to break past bulkier Pokemon like Alomomola and Hippowdon due to its mediocre offensive presence without a Z-Move.", "Hakamo-o": null, "Swanna": "Swanna has both a great offensive and defensive typing; it is incredibly difficult to switch into and is also a decent check to the many popular Fighting-types like Gurdurr, Primeape, and Hitmonchan. Swanna's higher-than-average Speed tier lets it outspeed important threats such as Jynx and Primeape, and as a Choice Scarf user it is capable of outspeeding key threats such as Choice Scarf Togedemaru and +1 Lilligant. Because Swanna is so effective at forcing switches and has few true counters, it can use the free turns generated to provide Defog support for its teammates, giving it further utility. Unfortunately, neither Swanna's offenses nor its defenses are particularly impressive. Its offenses are made up for by its high-powered STAB attacks, but Hurricane's accuracy and Brave Bird's recoil are both disappointing. Its defenses are made even worse by a weakness to Stealth Rock, leaving it unable to consistently wall many stronger threats.", "Ducklett": "Although Ducklett carries respectable defensive stats, it provides little to no power upfront. In addition, the utility it provides is not good; Defog is better on Vullaby, which can easily fit into teams with a mixture of sets. Finally, a poor Speed stat and a weakness to Stealth Rock jeopardize Ducklett's ability to even get a Defog off when switching in directly.", "Celesteela": "Celesteela is a solid defensive Pokemon in the tier, with a fantastic typing, well-rounded stats, and a large movepool. Steel / Flying typing along with massive bulk allows Celesteela to check many threats in the tier such as Tapu Lele, Mega Diancie, Mega Alakazam, Mega Latios, Garchomp, Tapu Bulu, and Landorus-T. Even though Celesteela lacks reliable recovery, access to Leech Seed allows it to sustain itself against non-Grass-types. Celesteela struggles with the high usage of Zapdos, which shuts down all sets and PP stalls Leech Seed easily. On top of this, many Pokemon Celesteela is supposed to beat are constantly adapting to its presence and running Z-Moves in order to remove it or drastically weaken it, with examples being Fightinium Z on Tapu Lele.", "Kommo-o": "Kommo-o is a valuable addition to a number of offensive teams, as the combination of a powerful Z-Move, colorful coverage, and access to Stealth Rock makes it simultaneously one of the best sweepers and Stealth Rock users for such teams. Likewise, Belly Drum with Salac Berry is also a deadly sweeper that can be quite the useful addition to hyper offense by cleaning up teams or punching hole for fellow sweepers. Kommo-o's bulk and typing are beneficial to its offensive role too, letting it act as a soft check to many Pokemon that are troublesome to offense, such as Ash-Greninja, Blacephalon, Tyranitar, and Heatran while allowing Kommo-o to set up Stealth Rock or Substitutes on a number of common Pokemon in the tier, such as Ferrothorn, Jirachi, and Tapu Bulu. Its bulk and typing also make it resistant to a number of forms of revenge killing, such as Choice Scarf Kartana and priority like Water Shuriken or Sucker Punch. Alternatively, a specially defensive set can also be run on stall teams, which provides stall a switch-in to notable breakers such as Blacephalon, Heatran, Tyranitar, and Mega Gyarados. However, Kommo-o does have its downsides. Its typing, while good in a lot of regards, leaves it weak to some common typings like Psychic, Ice, and especially Fairy. This weakness to Fairy also extends to the fact that Fairy-types can easily block its Z-Move and prevent it from sweeping, as can Pokemon sacrificed to entry hazard damage. Additionally, its Speed is only decent, meaning offensive sets are prone to being revenge killed by faster Pokemon like Choice Scarf Landorus-T and Choice Scarf Greninja. As for the specially defensive set, it can struggle defensively due to a lack of access to any reliable recovery, making it over-reliant on Wish support from other members of its team.", "Skuntank": "Skuntank is a very versatile Pokemon in PU thanks to its unique Poison / Dark typing, access to Pursuit and Sucker Punch along with support moves like Defog and Taunt, and ability to run several viable sets; these qualities also make it easy to fit on most teams. Skuntank's typing allows it to check Dark- and Grass-types such as Liepard and Lilligant while also giving it a helpful immunity against Psychic-types like Mesprit and to Prankster moves from foes like Sableye. Access to both Pursuit and Sucker Punch gives Skuntank the ability to trap a Pokemon or revenge kill it, which is especially useful against Psychic- and Ghost-types or frail Pokemon. Skuntank\u2019s reasonable Speed tier, decent Attack, and ability to run both physical and special sets make it strong offensive threat that's difficult to predict at Team Preview. Skuntank is the best hazard remover in PU, in part by virtue of being a Poison-type, meaning it's able to absorb Toxic Spikes upon switching in and then use Defog to remove remaining entry hazards. Aftermath is a notable ability due to it dealing 1/4 damage to a foe if it KOes Skuntank with a contact move. Regardless, even though it provides excellent role compression, Skuntank\u2019s stats are all average to mediocre. This means that while it does have several roles that it fills, it does all of them to an average standard while also not being able to hit that hard or take unresisted hits.", "Bibarel": "Bibarel finds a small niche in the PU metagame as a sweeper thanks to its ability Simple, which doubles positive stat changes, in conjunction with Swords Dance, allowing Bibarel's Attack to reach high levels and letting Bibarel break past opposing Pokemon easily. Bibarel's unique STAB combination allows it to hit the majority of the tier for neutral damage, so when it is able to boost its Attack, it will always heavily damage opposing Pokemon. Unfortunately, Bibarel has very poor defensive stats, a poor Speed stat, and mediocre Attack, making it quite slow and weak without a Swords Dance boost. It faces strong competition with many offensive Water-types in the tier such as Kingler, Floatzel, and Kabutops due to them being more reliable sweepers with higher Attack and Speed stats than Bibarel. Bibarel also faces strong competition as a Normal-type wallbreaker with Kangaskhan and Zangoose, which also possess higher Attack and Speed stats. Furthermore, Bibarel is walled by the likes of Gourgeist-XL and Tangela, which can take its STAB attacks and threaten it back with strong super effective attacks.", "Meowstic": null, "Gothitelle": null, "Squirtle": "Squirtle's diverse movepool, including support moves such as Fake Out and Rapid Spin, makes it seem appealing, but its lackluster stats hold it back from ever being useful in Little Cup. All of its possible sets are outclassed by other, better Water-types such as Staryu and Corphish, with any niches it has over these Pokemon being small or insignificant. Squirtle is a pretty terrible Pokemon in general and doesn't fit on nearly any team.", "Exploud": "Despite having a good offensive movepool and a powerful Scrappy Boomburst, Exploud is outclassed by Swellow. Swellow has fantastic speed and outspeeds Salazzle and Virizion notably, immunity to Ground moves, and U-turn to provide its team with momentum. Exploud is very slow, has no defensive utility whatsoever, and is more vulnerable to being revenge killed. Unlike Swellow, Exploud is heavily prediction reliant on teams with solid Normal-resistant Pokemon like Registeel and Tyrantrum.", "Wimpod": "Thanks to access to Spikes and Taunt as well as having a great Speed stat, Wimpod can function as a decent suicide lead on offensive teams, as it is the fastest user of Spikes. Thanks to its 18 Speed, it can notably outspeed every common lead in the metagame, including Onix and Dwebble. Its ability Wimp Out allows it to usually get up one layer of Spikes and immediately give a teammate a safe switch. This can give your team a lot of momentum, and in combination with Spikes can put your opponent on the backfoot from the start of the game. However, Wimpod's stats other than its Speed are bad, meaning it will be knocked out easily and unable to do much damage in return. In addition, its movepool is very lacking, making it struggle to hit Pokemon that aren't weak to its STAB moves. This makes it incredibly passive. Wimpod's typing leaves it weak to Rock, not only meaning it is weak to Stealth Rock but also that it loses to common leads like Dwebble and Onix. At the same time, Wimpod faces a lot of competition from these Pokemon, as they have greater bulk and can set up entry hazards more consistently thanks to their less situational abilities, though Wimp Out does give Wimpod a small niche. However, Wimp Out can also be a curse, as a faster Pokemon can easily knock it below half HP, thus forcing it to switch out, meaning Wimpod cannot get up a layer of Spikes. Since it is unable to do much other than set up Spikes, Wimpod is very predictable, and opponents will thus easily be able to see its lead coming. Lastly, after it has been forced out because of Wimp Out, it struggles to get back in due to its weakness to Stealth Rock and general frailty.", "Skiploom": null, "Unfezant": "Unfezant may seem good on paper, boasting a solid Attack stat, decent Speed, and Super Luck, but that's where the positives end. Unfezant's lack of a good movepool makes it outclassed terribly by Dodrio and even Toucannon, since they actually get access to strong Flying-type STAB moves whereas Unfezant is stuck with mediocre 60-Base Power moves like Pluck and Aerial Ace. Unfezant's Speed tier is good, but it is still outsped by common Choice Scarf users and offensive Pokemon such as Togedemaru and Lycanroc, which can easily dispose of it. Finally, Unfezant is often forced to run a support set that relies on the 60% Hypnosis due to its limited movepool. It's very unreliable in the metagame because of this and has reason to be used over good offensive Flying-types such as Dodrio and Oricorio-G that possess a better matchup against bulky Rock- and Steel-type Pokemon like Regirock and Aggron.", "Deino": "Deino may appear to be a strong wallbreaker with its arsenal of good coverage moves backed by Hustle, but its capability in the current Little Cup metagame is actually rather limited. Its Speed is terrible, forcing it to use a Choice Scarf or risk being overrun by faster threats. While its defensive typing gives it useful resistances to Water, Grass, Electric, and Dark, its weaknesses to common Fighting- and Fairy-types only further limit its usefulness. Deino's reliance on Hustle as its main source of power means it is unreliable, ultimately leaving Deino as a poor choice in a metagame full of more potent threats.", "Archen": "Thanks to a great base 112 Attack and a good base 70 Speed, Archen is a strong offensive Pokemon in Little Cup. Its unique Rock / Flying typing also makes it a good check to Normal- and Flying-types, such as Bunnelby and Rufflet, while also giving STAB to powerful moves such as Stone Edge and Acrobatics. Archen's interesting utility movepool, which includes U-turn, Knock Off, Stealth Rock, Defog, and Roost, also allows it to support its team in various ways.", "Mime Jr.": null, "Klang": null, "Remoraid": "Remoraid is able to fit on offensive teams functioning as a revenge killer and cleaner, which is helped by great mixed attacking stats, a respectable 17 Speed tier, and a vast movepool. Water Spout is Remoraid's main selling point, as its high Base Power at full health allows Remoraid to significantly damage the opposition. Remoraid has access to coverage options such as Fire Blast to hit Grass-types and Bullet Seed for Water-types, which is boosted by Hustle. However, Hustle lowers the accuracy of physical moves, leading to unfortunate misses when using Bullet Seed. Additionally, Remoraid has terrible bulk, leaving it easily revenge killed by priority attacks such as Mach Punch and Sucker Punch. Lastly, it faces competition from other special Water-types such as Chinchou and Frillish, as they provide defensive utility and are more reliable.", "Seismitoad": "Seismitoad stands out as a reliable Stealth Rock setter thanks to its fantastic defensive typing and ability in Water Absorb, allowing it to take on common Stealth Rock leads like Rhydon and Steelix as well as check prominent Pokemon such as Incineroar and Slowking. This is further bolstered by Seismitoad's solid natural bulk and expansive movepool, allowing it to function as either a defensive tank or an offensive lure to switch-ins such as Xatu and Whimsicott. However, Seismitoad is held back by its lack of reliable recovery, making it easy to wear down, and thus receives competition from Slowking and Vaporeon as a bulky Water-type. Defensive sets are very passive, meaning they struggle to set up Stealth Rock versus Xatu and can be used as setup fodder for Pokemon like Braviary and Type: Null. More offense-oriented sets sacrifice the bulk to avoid being 2HKOed by Pokemon such as Rhydon and additionally lack the power and appropriate coverage to threaten bulky Pokemon such as Slowking, Vaporeon, and Defensive Torterra. Despite having a solid defensive typing, Seismitoad's 4x weakness is commonplace in NU, with Grass-types like Sceptile and Whimsicott able to easily pressure it, as well as Freeze-Dry users such as Mega Glalie. Certain Pokemon Seismitoad intends to check may also carry Grass-type coverage such as Slowking and Delphox.", "Swinub": "Despite its good offensive typing and solid movepool, Swinub is held back by its poor bulk and Speed stat as well as a bad defensive typing. Swinub heavily competes with other Stealth Rock setters such as Onix and Tirtouga, the former of which has a higher Speed stat and the latter of which has higher offensive capabilities to pressure entry hazard removers. Both Onix and Tirtouga also have access to Sturdy and are able to switch into Flying-types such as Vullaby due to their higher physical bulk.", "Misdreavus": "Misdreavus finds its place in the PU metagame as a Fighting-type check, a spinblocker, and a good utility Pokemon with an unpredictable support movepool. For example, it is able to punish potential switch-ins like Lilligant and Swanna with Thunder Wave and can run a number of other options in its last moveslot, such as Pain Split, Memento, Destiny Bond, and Nasty Plot. However, Misdreavus is often overshadowed as a Ghost-type by the likes of Jellicent, Oricorio-G, Froslass, and Sableye, as these Pokemon have more reliable means of recovery and are not overly reliant on Eviolite like Misdreavus is. Misdreavus does, however, have some niche attributes that allows allow it to stand out among the other Ghost-types in the tier. The main niche Misdreavus holds is its ability to outspeed Pokemon such as Skuntank and Absol and cripple them with Will-O-Wisp, which Sableye is unable to do due to Dark-types being immune to Prankster moves. Another quality Misdreavus brings to the table is being a fast Taunt user that can put pressure on bulkier teams consisting of Pokemon such as Clefairy and Munchlax that are easily shut down by Taunt. However, Misdreavus's reliance on Eviolite can often be a burden for it, as this makes Misdreavus very weak to Knock Off, meaning it can struggle to check Fighting-types such as Gurdurr and Throh that threaten it on the switch. This is one of the main reasons why other Ghost-types such as Colbur Berry Jellicent and bulky Oricorio-G are more easy to fit on teams; the former only takes neutral damage from Knock Off and threatens Fighting-types with Psychic, while the latter often carries Flyinium Z or Colbur Berry, which allows it to take reduced damage from Knock Off.", "Totodile": "Thanks to access to Dragon Dance and a great ability in Sheer Force, Totodile can be a decently threatening late-game sweeper. Its access to good coverage moves in Superpower and Sheer Force-boosted Ice Punch allows Totodile to break through common checks to offensive Water-types, like Ferroseed and Foongus. Totodile can also use a STAB priority move in Aqua Jet, allowing it to revenge kill frail or weakened threats like Doduo and Abra. It also has decent natural bulk as well as a good defensive Water typing, meaning it can usually find a setup opportunity. However, Totodile faces a lot of competition from other physically offensive Water-types like Carvanha and Corphish. The latter in particular also has access to Dragon Dance, is more powerful than Totodile thanks to Adaptability, and can weaken walls more easily thanks to access to Knock Off. However, Totodile carves a niche for itself thanks to its access to Ice Punch, as this gives it a reliable way to hit bulky Grass-types like Foongus and Snivy. Totodile is also quite slow, meaning it can relatively easily be revenge killed by many Choice Scarf users like Doduo and Mienfoo. Lastly, Totodile struggles to break through bulky Water-types like Staryu and Mareanie, so teams that have one of these will easily be able to prevent its sweep.", "Maractus": "Even with access to Spikes, Maractus struggles to find a niche over other Grass-types with Spikes like Roselia and Cacturne. Roselia has a much higher defensive presence, while Cacturne has a much higher offensive presence, and both having secondary typings. Even when used as a lead, Maractus's stats bar its Special Attack are mediocre, most notably its Speed, which means it often can only set up one layer of Spikes before being KOed. Furthermore, other common leads like Qwilfish and Froslass can Taunt Maractus and stop it from setting up Spikes at all, or they can be removed later in the game by the abundance of entry hazard removers like Skuntank, many of which beat Maractus in a matchup, which essentially negates its one goal.", "Stufful": "Stufful is a unique and decent setup sweeper that can also function as an emergency check to physical attackers. Thanks to Fluffy and a good HP stat, Stufful is very physically bulky and can check Pokemon like Pawniard. It's not passive, either, hitting 18 Attack and getting access to Swords Dance. Normal / Fighting is a good offensive typing, letting Stufful's STAB moves hit almost the entire metagame, bar Ghost-types, for at least neutral damage. Stufful also gets good coverage moves like Ice Punch to hit Grass-types such as Pumpkaboo-XL and Foongus, Earthquake to hit Poison-types like Mareanie and Alolan Grimer, and Rock Slide to hit Flying- and Fire-types such as Vullaby and Larvesta. Unfortunately, for a sweeper, Stufful is quite slow, and while its physical bulk is phenomenal, its Special Defense is poor. It is completely walled by Ghost-types due to its only way of hitting them hard, Brutal Swing, having such a low Base Power. Fluffy gives Stufful a pseudo-weakness to Fire, meaning it is easily pressured by special Fire-types like Houndour and, to a lesser extent, physical Fire-types like Ponyta and Larvesta. As a result, Stufful is easily revenge killed and requires significant support to thrive. Stufful's best Fighting-type STAB attack with no drawback is Brick Break, and it misses out on the better STAB moves that other Fighting-types get, like Drain Punch, High Jump Kick, and Close Combat. Even with Fluffy, Stufful struggles against opposing Fighting-types and almost always loses against them one-on-one. Thus, it faces incredible amounts of competition from top-tier Fighting-types like Croagunk, Mienfoo, and Timburr, since many of the things Stufful does, they do as well.", "Zebstrika": "Zebstrika stands out among Electric-types thanks to its amazing Speed tier, which allows it to outspeed almost all of the unboosted metagame, including threats like Floatzel, and serve as a nice revenge killer and late-game cleaner. It also has two great abilities in Sap Sipper and Lightning Rod, allowing it to switch into Grass-types like Lilligant and Volt Switch users like Manectric. Sadly, Zebstrika\u2019s Special Attack can be pretty underwhelming even with a Life Orb, and it often can be easily checked by common threats such as Lanturn, which also stops its Volt Switch. Due in part to its mediocre bulk, Zebstrika can be easily chipped through priority, hazards, and its own Life Orb recoil, making it fear Choice Scarf and priority users. Lastly, it still gets competition from other Electric-types that can provide more offensive pressure. Alolan Raichu and Manectric are notable Electric-types in this category due to their unique niches: Alolan Raichu has a secondary Psychic typing and access to Nasty Plot, whereas Manectric has access to Switcheroo; however, Zebstrika still manages to maintain its niche with its high Speed and access to multiple useful abilities.", "Empoleon": "Empoleon has access to a variety of utility options such as Defog, Stealth Rock, and Roar, enabling it to support its team in various ways. Its incredible defensive typing and natural bulk allow it to check a multitude of common threats in the tier, including Latias, Primarina, and Mega Pidgeot. Additionally, Empoleon's ability to force out these threats provides it with a ton of opportunities to either set up Stealth Rock or clear entry hazards from the field. While Empoleon faces competition as a hazard remover from Tentacruel, which has access to Toxic Spikes, its fantastic secondary Steel typing and greater mixed bulk give it an edge. However, its typing also leaves it weak to common offensive types such as Electric, Fighting, and Ground, making it easily exploited by Pokemon like Mega Manectric, Cobalion, and Krookodile. Furthermore, Empoleon lacks reliable recovery, which makes it prone to being worn down, although moves such as Protect can be run to mitigate this. Empoleon struggles to fit all of its great status options on one set, which can leave it hurting in some matchups.", "Wooper": "Wooper's incredible defensive typing in combination with Water Absorb as well as its access to reliable recovery makes it one of the most consistent counters to some of the common Water- and Electric-types in the tier, such as Staryu, Chinchou, and Magnemite, and allows Wooper to consistently wall these threats throughout the game. It also has access to interesting support options such as Yawn, Encore, and Haze. However, Wooper's low offensive stats mean that it can often be setup bait. Its bulk is also low for a defensive Pokemon, especially on the special side, meaning that powerful wallbreakers such as Life Orb Doduo and Abra will easily be able to break it. In addition, both of Wooper's STAB moves are resisted by Grass-types, which also threaten it with a 4x super effective STAB move, meaning that it is easily countered by common Pokemon such as Pumpkaboo-XL and Foongus. Its weakness to Grass also means it has to be very careful of Grass-type coverage on certain Pokemon such as Ponyta and Clamperl that it would otherwise be able to check.", "Makuhita": "Makuhita differentiates itself from other Fighting-types with its unique access to Belly Drum. However, its lackluster Attack that mandates Belly Drum setup and atrocious bulk, exacerbated by the fact that Makuhita's not holding Eviolite, makes setting up inconsistent. Makuhita also faces immense competition from other Belly Drum users such as Zigzagoon and Magby, which don't necessitate Sticky Web to function, and more consistent Fighting-types such as Mienfoo and Timburr.", "Alakazam": "Alakazam is a notable threat to the OU metagame due to the valuable offensive niche it holds. Mega Alakazam is a fantastic special wallbreaker and sweeper, as its great Speed means it is outsped only by some Choice Scarf users. It also possesses the highest Special Attack stat in the tier as well as a useful ability in Trace, which lets it copy a plethora of useful abilities. It can trace Flash Fire and Levitate, letting it wall Heatran and Mega Latios lacking Draco Meteor, respectively. Regenerator can be traced from the likes of Toxapex, Tangrowth, and Tornadus-T to keep Mega Alakazam healthy. And even other situational abilities like Swift Swim, Beast Boost, and Soul-Heart can be occasionally copied. However, Mega Alakazam to some extent struggles to hurt some bulkier teams due to the presence of Magearna, Celesteela, and Ferrothorn. Regular Alakazam's niche lies in its access to Magic Guard, which allows it to run a Life Orb set that, just like its mega forme, can switch into threats like Heatran reliably and force them out. Unfortunately, Alakazam and Mega Alakazam are both extremely frail and are thus extremely vulnerable to Choice Scarf users and priority, which are both quite common. They also are susceptible to common attacks in Pursuit, U-turn, and Knock Off.", "Dragalge": "Dragalge's unique typing in conjunction with its above average bulk and Adaptability ability allows it to function as a defensive and offensive powerhouse in the RU tier. It is able to pivot into threats such as Venusaur, Diancie, Rotom-C, and Salazzle while being the only Dragon-type in the tier that can reliably switch in on and threaten the tier's Fairy-types, such as Diancie, Florges, and Comfey, bar Gardevoir. Dragalge has access to high-Base Power STAB moves such as Draco Meteor and Sludge Wave that synergize with Adaptability as well as coverage moves such as Scald and Focus Blast. However, while Dragalge has the capability to tank hits, its lack of reliable recovery causes it to be susceptible to chip damage, status conditions, and entry hazards. It is one of the slowest Pokemon in the tier, which usually means that it is forced to take at least two hits when pivoting in.", "Cherrim": "Cherrim is an atrocious Sunny Day sweeper, as it possesses a terrible movepool and mediocre stats bar its average Speed tier, but that does not save it by far. It is easily walled even if it manages to get boosted up, leaving it outclassed by other physical Sunny Day sweepers such as Leafeon, Shiftry, and Sawsbuck. However, it is even more outclassed by Lilligant and Victreebel if running a special set, which is what forces it to go physical with its one mediocre niche being Flower Gift. This notably leaves Cherrim walled by virtually most of the tier.", "Seel": null, "Salandit": "Salandit can make for a relatively good wallbreaker with its high Speed, good offensive typing, and good Special Attack. Its hidden ability, Oblivious, lets it set up Nasty Plot without needing to worry about being Taunted; getting Taunted is not a big problem for most set up sweepers in the first place, but it can be useful. However, Salandit's huge weakness to trappers largely holds it back from its full potential. It also has paper-thin defenses, being OHKOed by almost every super effective hit. But, despite its weaknesses, Salandit can shine through in the right scenarios.", "Klink": "Klink's access to Shift Gear, which raises Speed by 2 stages and Attack by 1 stage, and Gear Grind, which gives Klink a way to break through Sturdy and Focus Sash and deal good damage, allows it to function as a good late-game sweeper. Its nice bulk backed up by a Steel typing allows it to resist Stealth Rock and nine other types as well as take a lot of attacks, making it easy to set up Shift Gear. However, Klink has a terrible movepool that leaves it walled by many common Pokemon such as Pawniard, Magnemite, and Mudbray. It has common weaknesses in Fighting, Fire, and Ground. In addition, it faces severe competition with other sweepers such as Scraggy, Corphish, and Vullaby and has trouble finding a niche in teams. It\u2019s slow before a Shift Gear boost, leaving it easily hit by Taunt. Even after a Shift Gear, Klink\u2019s subpar Attack doesn't make it particularly powerful, meaning that multiple boosts are required to significantly damage teams.", "Carbink": "Carbink is one of the best Trick Room setters in the tier thanks to its access to Sturdy, which give it great odds at setting Trick Room successfully. It is also one of PU's premier special walls thanks to its amazing defensive typing and stats, which allow it to check threatening offensive Pokemon such as Drampa, Oricorio-G, and Pyroar. Furthermore, these traits almost guarantee that Carbink will set up Stealth Rock in a match. On the downside, Carbink's abysmal Speed leaves it as an open target for Taunt users like Weezing. Despite Carbink's amazing defenses, its low HP stat, along with its weakness to common attacking types like Water, Ground, and Grass means that it struggles to take hits from powerful attackers such as Kingler and Alolan Exeggutor, which both 2HKO Carbink with ease, and while Steel-type coverage moves may not be as common, Steel-types like Alolan Dugtrio and Aggron can easily exploit Carbink's 4x weakness. Unfortunately, Carbink faces competition from other bulky Stealth Rock users such as Regirock and Carracosta, which have a combination of better offensive presence, better stats, and better support movepools. Despite these weaknesses, Carbink still holds a niche as one of the best Trick Room setters, and its ability to switch into Drampa is unrivaled.", "Darmanitan": "Darmanitan carves its niche in the UU metagame by being one of the hardest-hitting Pokemon in the tier due to its Sheer Force-boosted Flare Blitz, making it incredibly hard to switch into when holding a Choice Band and able to easily 2HKO some of the tier's most common physical walls, such as Gligar, Hippowdon, and Tentacruel. However, Darmanitan's poor Fire typing leaves it vulnerable to Stealth Rock damage and the plethora of Water- and Ground-type moves that flood the tier. Moreover, its terrible defensive stats mean that Darmanitan struggles to switch into resisted attacks, fails to check Pokemon like Scizor, Bisharp, and Cobalion, which most other Fire-types have defensive utility against, and heavily relies on prediction or VoltTurn support to come in safely. Recoil damage from Flare Blitz also severely hinders Darmanitan's longevity and only gives it a few opportunities to fire off Flare Blitz throughout the match. These aforementioned flaws usually make Darmanitan's use hard to justify over other Fire-types with better movepools or stats, such as Infernape and Moltres.", "Turtonator": "Turtonator finds its place in the PU metagame as a threatening Shell Smash sweeper. Offensively, its Fire / Dragon typing boasts unresisted coverage against everything in the tier. It is free to run a Z-Move such as Devastating Drake that allows it to beat blanket checks like Hitmonchan after a Shell Smash. Good physical bulk lets it set up against weaker physical attackers such as Shiftry. Turtonator's main flaw is its low Speed, meaning it can easily be outsped and revenge killed after Stealth Rock damage by common Choice Scarf users such as Primeape, Jynx, and Mesprit even after a Shell Smash. Its typing can often hinder it as well, as it is weak to Stealth Rock and lacks notable resistances outside of Grass, Fire, and Electric. Turtonator is generally only seen on niche hyper offense teams, because other Fire- or Dragon-types such as Combusken and Drampa are able to inflict immediate damage or have better defensive utility.", "Popplio": null, "Vanillish": null, "Reuniclus": "Reuniclus is one of the most reliable setup sweepers in the OU metagame thanks to its solid typing, bulk, and access to Magic Guard and Recover. Thanks to its Psychic typing, Reuniclus can check Fighting- and Psychic-types such as Mega Medicham and Tapu Lele, which are dominant forces in the metagame. It may look like Reuniclus is walled by Steel-types such as Ferrothorn, Celesteela, and Curse Mega Scizor, but in reality, it can use them as setup bait thanks to its solid bulk and access to Magic Guard, Recover, Calm Mind, and Acid Armor. Ash-Greninja and Tyranitar are some of the most common Dark-types in the tier, and despite Reuniclus's typing, it can usually overcome them with Acid Armor and entry hazards. Reuniclus can set up fairly easy against passive balance teams and matches up decently well against offense and bulky offense as well. Thanks to its access to Psyshock, Reuniclus can beat other Calm Mind users, such as Clefable, Magearna, and Mega Alakazam. However, while its bulk is very solid, it usually has to take a hit before setting up due to its rather lacking Speed stat. Fighting- and Psychic-type Pokemon such as Keldeo and Mega Alakazam have access to secondary STAB moves or coverage moves to get past Reuniclus. Finally, Reuniclus is overly reliant on Toxic Spikes and Spikes and often can't pull off a sweep if they are not present on the opposing side of the field.", "Lickitung": "Lickitung can check many offensive threats in the metagame, such as Abra, Magnemite, Bellsprout, and Gastly, due to its great defensive stats. Furthermore, Lickitung's bulk combined with its access to Wish and Heal Bell make it a great support Pokemon on balanced and defensive teams. Lickitung can also use its support and status moves against Taunt users due to Oblivious. However, Lickitung's typing lacks resistances, meaning it has to rely on its raw bulk and Eviolite when switching into powerful attacks. Furthermore, Lickitung's low Speed combined with its passivity makes it struggle in such an offensive metagame and leaves it vulnerable to several offensive Pokemon in the tier. Lickitung also struggles against the common Fighting-types in the tier, such as Mienfoo and Timburr. Lastly, Lickitung faces competition from Spritzee as a Wish passer and cleric and from Munchlax as a Normal-type special wall.", "Tapu Koko": "Tapu Koko is a good offensive pivot in OU thanks to an ideal combination of speed, power, and a variety of team-supporting utilities at its disposal. Its base 130 Speed certainly stands out, allowing it to outrun and revenge KO most non-Choice Scarf Pokemon in OU sans Mega Alakazam, Mega Lopunny, and Ash-Greninja. Its fantastic Speed tier complements its access to U-turn and Volt Switch as well as its powerful Electric-type attacks thanks to stacked boosts from STAB and Electric Surge. Additionally, Tapu Koko's access to Taunt allows it to pressure defensively-oriented teams, adding to its versatility. Though its bulk is nothing special, its access to Roost and decent defensive typing allow it to check Pokemon like Tornadus-T, Hawlucha, and Mega Pinsir. However, the latter two can bypass it in certain circumstances, be it through chipping Tapu Koko in range of a +2 High Jump Kick, or by catching it off guard with an Earthquake. Although it has decent coverage, moves outside of Electric-type attacks can be rather underwhelming due to low Base Power and Tapu Koko's only decent base 95 Special Attack stat. While its Attack stat is solid, Wild Charge's added recoil prevents Tapu Koko from being able to use it as often. Because Tapu Koko's bulk is just about average, it can typically only switch into resisted or particularly weak attacks.", "Magearna": "Thanks to its ability Soul-Heart, Magearna has the ability to snowball with Shift Gear sets, meaning that it is very hard to check late-game. It also has a great typing, which gives it resistances to common types like Fairy, Psychic, and Dark. This gives it good setup opportunities and allows it to function as a defensive check to Pokemon such as Clefable, Tapu Lele, Mega Alakazam, and Ash-Greninja. Magearna possesses over a high base 130 Special Attack with an excellent movepool consisting of good moves like Fleur Cannon, Focus Blast, Calm Mind, Shift Gear, and Thunderbolt. Essentially, Magearna can pick its check and counters due to the variety of Z-Crystals it can viably run on offensive sets, such as Fairium Z, Steelium Z, and Electrium Z, which hit a wide variety of Pokemon. Additionally, Magearna has access to Volt Switch, which allows it to act as a defensive pivot and gain momentum. Unfortunately, Magearna lacks any sort of reliable recovery whatsoever, meaning it can be worn down with ease. This means that most Magearna sets, Assault Vest sets especially, are prone to Spikes, because they will have a hard time switching into Pokemon such as Ash-Greninja and Tapu Lele multiple times throughout the match. Mediocre Speed prior to setup also means Magearna is susceptible to common Pokemon such as Heatran, Landorus-T, and Garchomp.", "Snorunt": "With an awful typing and 50 base stats across the board, Snorunt is completely unviable in Little Cup. Poor abilities in Inner Focus and Ice Body only continue to plummet Snorunt's value, and a lackluster movepool prevents it from being a semi-effective battler. Amaura has better coverage along with better attacking stats, making it the superior Ice-type in the metagame.", "Aipom": null, "Breloom": "Breloom is essentially a worse Kartana in almost every way. As an offensive Grass-type, it struggles to break through Pokemon that Kartana would have no issue with, such as Tangrowth, Clefable, Gliscor, and Tornadus-T. Breloom is slower than most of the metagame, forcing it to rely on Mach Punch to pose as any sort of threat against offensive teams. It's also very frail and struggles to find opportunities to set up. Furthermore, compared to Tapu Bulu, Kartana, and Tangrowth, it has virtually zero defensive utility. All in all, unless you have something against using Ultra Beasts or any other good wallbreaker for that matter, there's very little reason to use Breloom on a serious team.", "Drowzee": "Insomnia is Drowzee's most attractive feature, when you add that into its average defensive stats, gives it a nice role as a Foongus and Abra counter. Having semi-reliable recovery in Wish lets Drowzee stick around longer to perform its duties multiple times and check some other threats as well. However, Drowzee doesn't hit particularly hard which invites offensive threats such as Snivy to set up on it, and its Psychic typing is relatively easy to counter.", "Goldeen": "Goldeen has a fantastic ability in Lightning Rod, allowing it to be a great check to Electric-types such as Chinchou and Magnemite; it can also directly threaten them with Drill Run, making it one of the best stops to Volt Switch in the metagame. Its Water typing provides it with useful resistances to Water-, Ice-, and Steel-type attacks, which are commonly run as coverage by LC's premier Volt Switch users. Goldeen's movepool has useful options such as Knock Off, Megahorn, and specifically Bounce, which can be used alongside a Flyinium Z to let Goldeen lure in and KO Grass- and Fighting-types. Goldeen's good Attack and Speed allow it to put some offensive pressure on the opposing team. However, Goldeen generally faces competition as a physically offensive Water-type from the likes of Corphish, which has extremely strong STAB attacks thanks to Adaptability and access to Dragon Dance and Swords Dance, and Carvanha, which hits harder, more consistently breaks through Grass-types, and has Speed Boost to outpace normally faster Pokemon. Goldeen's bad bulk also doesn't help its case, as it takes massive damage from powerful neutral hits and will almost always get OHKOed by super effective attacks. Finally, Goldeen lacks a good way to hit bulky Water- and Flying-types as well as Grass- and Fighting-types after Supersonic Skystrike has been used up, meaning that it can be walled fairly easily by Pokemon like Timburr and Foongus.", "Pidgey": "Pidgey is unviable in the Little Cup metagame due to its poor stats, mediocre typing, and average movepool. While other Flying-types may find a niche due to useful abilities or high stats, Pidgey has nothing to warrant including it over another Flying-type on any competitive team. Its stats and movepool leave it completely outclassed by Doduo, Vullaby, and Rufflet, among others.", "Rotom-Mow": "Rotom-C finds its niche as a support Pokemon thanks to its acceptable defensive stats and typing along with its access to utility moves such as Will-O-Wisp and Defog. Rotom-C's typing allows it to come in on and use Defog against the majority of Stealth Rock setters. However, Rotom-C's typing also leaves it prone to threats such as Salazzle and Mega Glalie. Despite having Special Attack investment and often using Grassium Z, Rotom-C still struggles to take out some of the more prevalent special walls such as Cresselia, Gligar, and Umbreon due to its mediocre Special Attack stat.", "Yanma": null, "Meowth": "Meowth carves itself a niche as an excellent revenge killer with its Fake Out + Feint combination, which is considerably powerful thanks to STAB combined with Technician. In tandem with Fake Out, Feint can take care of many sweepers like Abra, Zigzagoon, and Carvanha without opposition. Meowth also hits the coveted 19 Speed tier, allowing it to outpace almost the entire unboosted metagame, including threats like Mienfoo and Chinchou, and Speed tying with Ponyta. It's also an excellent anti-lead that is able to reliably take care of Onix and Dwebble. Unfortunately, Meowth is beaten by common priority attacks like Vacuum Wave and Mach Punch. It suffers from four-moveslot syndrome, as it's unable to carry all the coverage it needs, forcing it to be vulnerable to at least one of its checks. It's also incredibly frail and will usually get knocked out if it can't KO what's in front of it. Meowth is forced to run Life Orb, as it's fairly weak without one.", "Fennekin": "Fennekin can utilize Magician to make Solar Beam with Power Herb a viable coverage option. However, its stats are so low that it's outsped by most offensive Pokemon, not strong enough to KO neutral foes, and unable to take even neutral hits. Fennekin is always an inferior choice over Ponyta thanks to the latter's much higher stats and better movepool overall.", "Kirlia": null, "Torkoal": "Torkoal is a reliable setter for sun teams, making the playstyle a very viable option. As a result, Torkoal makes Pokemon such as Venusaur, Leafeon, and Charizard viable as well. Other than that, Torkoal has the privilege of learning Stealth Rock, as well as boasting a high Defense stat, which makes it capable of checking physically offensive Pokemon such as Mega Glalie, Choice Scarf Heracross, Doublade, and Durant. It also checks strong Psyshock users such as Gardevoir. Moreover, Torkoal has access to support moves including Will-O-Wisp and Yawn, which helps its partners in breaking the opposing team. However, Torkoal lacks reliable recovery and has a poor defensive typing, being weak to Stealth Rock and having weaknesses to common types like Water, Ground, and Rock. Torkoal is also very slow, drains a lot of momentum upon switching in, and suffers from a poor Special Defense stat, which leaves it 2HKOed by most strong special attacks.", "Espurr": "Espurr brings passable Speed and Special Attack stats with it, along with a wide variety of coverage moves. However, it sports low bulk and is weak to priority moves such as Sucker Punch, preventing it from reliably dealing damage. Abra is not only faster, but it also carries a better Special Attack stat, making it the more desirable special wallbreaker and damage dealer.", "Whismur": "Terrible defenses, bad offenses, and low Speed mean that Whismur completely fails to carve a niche for itself. Despite having great coverage moves as many other Normal-types do, it simply doesn't have the stats to back it up. It best fits on Trick Room teams, as those allow it to use its awful Speed to its advantage while attempting to wallbreak with its many moves, but it is completely outclassed by other Trick Room wallbreakers like Spritzee, thanks to its access to the move, and Cranidos and Clamperl, which are simply far stronger than it. There are also several other Normal-types that are simply far better offensively, like Bunnelby and, on Trick Room, even Munchlax. All this, combined with Trick Room being horrible anyway due to the low amount of turns it has (an issue that is compounded by Whismur's struggle to OHKO most of the metagame), means that Whismur lacks a place in the metagame.", "Victreebel": "Victreebel is one of PU's most dangerous threats under sun. Thanks to Chlorophyll, Victreebel outspeeds the entire unboosted metagame as well as a majority of Choice Scarf users like Mesprit and Primeape even without having to run a Timid nature. A fantastic offensive typing in Grass / Poison coupled with Fire-type coverage backed up by a base 100 Special Attack makes Victreebel a great choice to clean in the late-game. Victreebel additionally has a plethora of status moves to choose from, including Sleep Powder, Growth, and Sunny Day. Victreebel separates itself from other sun sweepers by being the only fully evolved Pokemon in the tier to have access to Weather Ball + Chlorophyll. Victreebel also makes for a potent wallbreaker outside of sun teams thanks to its access to Strength Sap, which allows it to break past Pokemon like Skuntank and Gurdurr in conjunction with Grassium Z. However, Victreebel is incredibly frail and is susceptible to most forms of priority, especially Ice Shard. Victreebel also has a hard time breaking certain Pokemon, such as Type: Null and Curse Muk, without a boost. Moreover, it cannot make use of Solar Beam, Weather Ball, or Chlorophyll without sun, making sun sweeper sets setup fodder for Pokemon such as Carracosta and Oricorio-G.", "Skiddo": null, "Genesect": null, "Nidorino": null, "Nidorina": null, "Regigigas": "Regigigas at first glance looks good to use because of its stats, movepool, and great utility options; however, the problem lies in its ability Slow Start, as it halves its Attack and Speed for 5 turns, which takes out any offensive use for this Pokemon. Although Slow Start reactivates every time it switches in, Regigigas can still spread status and Knock Off items. It is outclassed by other Normal-type Pokemon like Stoutland and Kangaskhan because they have a more useful ability and more use offensively.", "Tentacruel": "Tentacruel's good Water / Poison defensive typing, which allows it to check threats such as Infernape and Scizor whilst absorbing Toxic Spikes, and access to Rapid Spin are what really set it apart from other Water-types in the tier. Additionally, good utility options in Toxic Spikes, Haze, and Knock Off give it the ability to support different playstyles and archetypes, and a good Speed tier also lets Tentacruel outspeed and heavily chip down threats to balance such as Mamoswine and Nidoking before going down without much investment. However, its subpar physical bulk and a lack of recovery outside of Z-Haze leave it hard pressed to check threats such as Scizor and Cobalion over the course of a game and reliant on teammates to serve as primary checks. Tentacruel\u2019s weakness to a common offensive typing in Ground, most Stealth Rock setters have, makes it more risky to remove entry hazards, even if they are forced out by Tentacruel\u2019s Scald. Tentacruel also faces competition from Starmie as a spinner due to the fact Starmie has a much higher offensive presence and can switch into common Stealth Rock users such as Hippowdon and Swampert reliably. Tentacruel\u2019s low damage output leaves it open to becoming setup fodder for bulky users, such as Reuniclus and Latias, even though Haze will deny their boosts if need be.", "Lickilicky": "Lickilicky might look good to use on stall teams because it has good bulk, keeps its teammates healthy with Wish, and gets rid of status with Heal Bell without worrying about Taunt users thanks to Oblivious. However, Lickilicky is outclassed by Audino, which takes advantage of Regenerator to recover its own HP upon switching out while passing Wish to a teammate.", "Weepinbell": null, "Slurpuff": "Slurpuff is a unique and incredibly threatening sweeper in the RU tier due to its access to both Unburden and Belly Drum, which can maximize its Attack and double its Speed in one turn. Thanks to its Fairy typing and decent bulk, Slurpuff is able to set up in front of any Choice-locked Dragon- or Fighting-type Pokemon like Zygarde-10%, Goodra and Bewear. Unfortunately, popular Steel-types in the tier such as Metagross, Registeel and Bronzong can thwart a potential Slurpuff sweep if they are kept relatively healthy. Furthermore, Slurpuff's sweep can similarly be cut short by status ailments and priority moves such as Machamp and Pangoro's Bullet Punch and as such faces competition from Linoone, whose Belly Drum and Extreme Speed combination makes it far harder to revenge kill. Unburden only activating once means Slurpuff is only granted one setup opportunity; it is typically useless in a match until you are able to find a time to set up safely.", "Tapu Fini": "The main standout to Tapu Fini's niche is the fact that it is a Defog user that beats the two arguably best entry hazard setters in the tier in Heatran and Ash-Greninja while still having a decent matchup against other Stealth Rock users like Landorus-T, Mega Tyranitar, Gliscor, and Mega Diancie. Tapu Fini also acts as a decent check to the likes of Hawlucha and Keldeo. Misty Terrain is also incredibly helpful, keeping teammates safe from status, with some notable examples being keeping Mega Mawile protected from Will-O-Wisp and bulky Volcarona safe from Toxic. Taunt is also a wonderful move to have, enabling Tapu Fini to shut down the likes of Toxapex and Reuniclus. However, the lack of reliable recovery is still very crippling to Tapu Fini, meaning it's prone to getting worn down over the course of a match, especially if it has to check more than one Pokemon on the opposing team. This in turn means Tapu Fini will often need teammates as backup checks to what it's meant to check. By extension, that also means Tapu Fini hates getting its item removed, as Leftovers is its sole form of recovery, which means it even goes as far to demand a Knock Off resistance as a teammate. Additionally, the nature of its set means Tapu Fini is forced to pick two out of Moonblast, Scald, and Nature's Madness, which naturally hinders its matchup against some Pokemon it's supposed to check. Lastly, Tapu Fini also faces some competition from other Water-types like Toxapex thanks to the rather narrow niche it fills, and it also dislikes the prevalence of Grass-types like Tapu Bulu, Tangrowth, and Amoonguss, which it can't do much against.", "Necrozma": "Necrozma is a reliable Pokemon that can function as either an offensive Stealth Rock setter or a wallbreaker that utilizes Z-Crystals. It has great matchups against common spinners such as Mega Blastoise, Forretress, and Donphan, letting it set Stealth Rock very reliably. It also has the ability to defensively and offensively check common Fighting-type Pokemon such as Virizion, Machamp, and Bewear. Necrozma's good stats and wide movepool make it very versatile and able to pick its checks and counters. Its Speed tier is also nice because it can reliably threaten Mega Blastoise and Nidoqueen. Prism Armor is a fantastic defensive ability that, combined with good bulk, allows Necrozma to survive super effective hits other Psychic-type Pokemon such as Gardevoir, Bronzong, and Slowbro cannot. However, Necrozma will always be walled or threatened by something common in RarelyUsed because it cannot cover everything with one moveset. Necrozma's Speed is decent for a wallbreaker, but it is still outpaced and threatened by offensive Pokemon such as Roserade, Gardevoir, Arcanine, and Yanmega. It lacks a reliable method to deal with status conditions, mainly Toxic, and has issues breaking bulky threats in spite of its good offenses. Specially offensive Necrozma has trouble with walls such as Snorlax, Florges, and Goodra, while physical variants can have problems beating Bronzong, Slowbro, and Seismitoad. Necrozma does have slight competition with other offensive Stealth Rock setters such as Metagross, Nidoqueen, and Alolan Marowak; Metagross has a better defensive typing, Nidoqueen has arguably better coverage and Sheer Force to boost its offenses, and Alolan Marowak provides immediate offensive pressure with Thick Club. However, Necrozma is arguably a better wallbreaker than Metagross thanks to Swords Dance and its amazing coverage moves, is faster than all three of them, has a better defensive ability, isn't weak to Stealth Rock, and has far more versatility.", "Dodrio": "Dodrio's fantastic offensive stats, near-unresisted coverage, and access to Swords Dance solidify it as a top offensive threat in PU that's able to blitz through Pokemon found on offensive and defensive teams alike. It can run a variety of sets that each offer immense amounts of offensive pressure: Swords Dance and Choice Band sets excel at wallbreaking, whereas Choice Scarf sets boast a near-unrivaled Speed tier. Since all of Dodrio's sets fit on offensive teams, deciphering what set it's running from Team Preview is nearly impossible, giving Dodrio the upper hand in many situations. However, Dodrio's lackluster bulk and weakness to Stealth Rock limit what it can safely switch into or use Swords Dance on, and it is easily worn down by Brave Bird's high recoil. Dodrio's matchups are also highly set dependent, as wallbreaking sets are prone to being revenge killed, while Choice Scarf lacks the power to break through bulky walls like Regirock, Quagsire, and Weezing.", "Dartrix": null, "Goodra": "Goodra's fantastic mixed offenses give it the capacity to run both Choice Band and Choice Specs sets, which makes it one of the most offensively versatile Pokemon available in the RU metagame and a fantastic wallbreaker in general. Its pure Dragon typing is quite useful, as alongside its Sap Sipper ability, it provides Goodra with key resistances to the tier's common Fire-, Water-, and Electric-type attacks and an immunity to Grass-type attacks, which give it plenty of opportunities to switch in and net KOs. Further enhancing its offensive capabilities are fantastic Special Defense and decent HP, which allow Goodra great bulk for an offensive Pokemon and the ability to tank some hits while dishing out damage, notably against the likes of powerful special attackers in Swellow, Zoroark, and even Florges. Also, Goodra can outspeed threats like Honchkrow and non-Choice Scarf Tyrantrum. However, despite its impressive offensive capabilities, Goodra sits at a rather inconvenient Speed tier that, alongside poor physical bulk, leaves it outsped by Pokemon that heavily threaten it in Flygon, Kommo-o, and Mega Glalie. Goodra also relies on either Choice Band or Choice Specs to effectively wallbreak, which means that careful prediction is required so as not to give the opponent free turns. The prevalence of both Fairy-types like Florges, Gardevoir, and Diancie and Steel-types like Registeel, Doublade, and Escavalier also troubles Goodra due to these Pokemon's ability to switch into Goodra's Choice-locked STAB attacks with ease. Other Dragon-type wallbreakers like Dragalge, Flygon, and Zygarde-10% are also a pain for Goodra, as they give it competition for a teamslot and heavily threaten it when on opposing teams. Lastly, Goodra's lack of recovery, susceptibility to entry hazards, and need to run maximum Speed investment usually keep it from reliably switching into neutral special attacks, which can at times compromise its tanking capabilities.", "Alomomola": "Alomomola has a great defensive typing, a huge HP stat, and a solid Defense stat, which allow it to blanket check a huge portion of the physically based metagame, including huge threats such as Infernape, Mega Sharpedo, and Cobalion. Its access to Wish provides great team utility and gives it a means of reliable recovery at the same time. Regenerator allows Alomomola to easily pivot in and out of the physical attackers it checks throughout a match. These traits allow it to fit comfortably on stall and balanced teams as a premier Wish passer that can blanket check many Pokemon. However, Alomomola is a pretty passive Pokemon because of its low offensive stats, meaning it can be turned into setup fodder by Pokemon that it cannot threaten, like Heracross, and Substitute users, such as Suicune and Kyurem. Its low Special Defense stat also means that it can be taken advantage of by special attackers such as Primarina and Hydreigon. While it only has two weaknesses, Pokemon that threaten Alomomola such as Rotom-H and Amoonguss see high usage. Alomomola is also very susceptible to Toxic Spikes and other entry hazards, which require removal if Alomomola wants to avoid the 2HKO from most of the attackers it checks. While very bulky, Alomomola is not bulky enough to take on extremely powerful wallbreakers such as Swords Dance Terrakion and Crawdaunt, which are big threats to balance and stall teams.", "Vespiquen": "Vespiquen's bulk, ability, and access to reliable recovery are completely mitigated by its mediocre typing, which leaves it incredibly weak to Stealth Rock, and its shallow movepool. It also has no offensive presence, which, combined with its typing and movepool, makes it a bad Fighting- and Grass-type check and leaves it walled by Steel-types like Alolan Sandslash. As a check to these types, Oricorio-E does the job better due to its better typing giving it more defensive utility, larger movepool, and higher offensive presence while still having access to reliable recovery.", "Trapinch": "Trapinch distinguishes itself from Diglett as a Ground-type trapper with its much higher Attack stat and greater bulk. Furthermore, Trapinch's defenses allow it to trap and KO several important threats that Diglett struggles with, such as Pawniard and Ponyta. However, outside of trapping specific threats, Trapinch is heavily outclassed by Diglett. Trapinch has incredibly low Speed and will nearly always take a hit before it gets to KO the Pokemon it traps. Its typing leaves it vulnerable to the common Water- and Grass-types in the tier. Trapinch also has a limited movepool, meaning it doesn't have enough coverage to hit most of the tier for super effective damage. Lastly, once Trapinch KOes a foe that it traps, it is susceptible to being revenge killed. Because of these flaws, Diglett is usually a superior choice over Trapinch, as it is much faster, has more utility, has priority, and can do roughly the same amount of damage.", "Cobalion": "Cobalion is one of the premier threats in the tier, with a versatile set of options including the ability to boost with both Swords Dance and Calm Mind, access to Stealth Rock, excellent Speed, and a great defensive typing that lets it check top-tier threats like Scizor, Hydreigon, and Bisharp. Its immunity to Toxic lets it come in on threats like Blissey and means it doesn't have to worry about losing to poison damage. Swords Dance is its flagship set, being very customizable and fulfilling a lot of roles besides that of a sweeper. Cobalion can run a variety of items to better fit the need of the team it is used on, with Z-Moves to wallbreak more easily, Rocky Helmet to punish physical attackers, and Shuca Berry to lure and remove Ground-types like Krookodile all being viable options. It is one of the best Pokemon at punishing Dark-types and Pursuit trappers thanks to its ability Justified, and its presence alone will make some of Cobalion's Dark-weak teammates able to be played more freely. There are some drawbacks to using Cobalion; notably, its Steel / Fighting dual typing leaves it without resistances to Psychic and Flying, which means that threats like Latias and Togekiss can be harder for Cobalion's team to deal with if it is the only Steel-type. It also faces competition from other offensive Stealth Rock users like Kommo-o, Nihilego, and Terrakion, all of which have more unboosted power and different defensive typings to take advantage of. It also is severely lacking in initial power before boosting, having a mediocre base 90 in both Attack and Special Attack. This leaves the Swords Dance set walled by Pokemon like Slowbro even after a boost, while the Calm Mind set can struggle to get KOs on even offensive Pokemon. The Calm Mind set's main competition in Nasty Plot Lucario can wallbreak much more easily, as well.", "Floatzel": "Thanks to its great Speed stat, Floatzel is able to outspeed almost the whole unboosted metagame and, in conjunction with its offensive stats, is able to pressure many offensive Pokemon such as Golurk, Lycanroc, and Alolan Dugtrio. Floatzel has access to a combination of almost unresisted coverage moves, which makes it one of the best offensive Water-types in the tier. It also has access to Taunt, which lets it annoy bulkier team builds. Swift Swim also gives it good matchup versus Pokemon like Kabutops in rain. However, Floatzel is not bulky and will be KOed by priority moves very easily, and, despite its very good Speed stat, it can still get outsped and revenge killed by common Choice Scarf users such as Primeape and Togedemaru.", "Electrode": "Despite being the second fastest Pokemon the tier has to offer, Electrode isn't viable in PU. Its incredibly limited movepool and subpar offensive stats allow its only role to be a supporting one, and even in that role it's outclassed by other Pokemon. Meowstic-M makes for a better dual screens lead, and even then, dual screens suicide leads aren't of much use in PU. Almost every Electric-type, like Togedemaru, Eelektross, and Lanturn, would be a better pick than Electrode, and even Meowstic-M outclasses Electrode. Mesprit is another Pokemon that does a better job at setting dual screens, but like Meowstic, it's vulnerable to Defog, while Electrode can at least use Taunt to prevent this.", "Gourgeist": "Gourgeist, while overshadowed by its XL forme as a defensive pivot, is able to carve out a niche as Z-Move user thanks to its good Speed tier that allows it to outspeed the unboosted metagame after a Z-Trick-or-Treat, bar Ninjask and Electrode. Z-Trick-or-Treat also gives it a considerable amount of bulk and increased Attack, though it's still quite lackluster compared to that of other setup sweepers. Even though Gourgeist struggles as a defensive pivot, it's still able to wall foes like Primeape due to its Ghost / Grass typing. While Gourgeist has quite a shallow physical movepool, with its lack of a strong Ghost-type STAB move other than Phantom Force meaning it has to put up with the charge turn, it just about gets by with attacks like Return, Seed Bomb, Shadow Sneak, and Rock Slide.", "Togepi": "Togepi has a small yet useful niche in LC as one of the tier's bulkiest Pokemon with access to Nasty Plot and Baton Pass. This allows Togepi to easily support teammates by supplying them with large boosts in Special Attack. A great defensive typing in pure Fairy allows Togepi to further secure its niche, providing it with key resistances to common attack types in Dark, Fighting, and Bug. Togepi can also pose a decent offensive threat once boosted, thanks to its workable Special Attack and diverse special movepool. Unfortunately, it faces severe competition as a defensive Fairy-type from the likes of Spritzee and Snubbull, which have better bulk, offensive presences, and overall utility. This severely limits Togepi's ability to fit on a very wide variety of teams and also makes it very predictable.", "Larvesta": "Larvesta has all the tools to be a bulky pivot. It has access to two excellent STAB moves in U-turn and Flare Blitz, allowing it to pivot and hit hard. It can utilize these moves with its good Attack stat and great ability in Flame Body, which allows it to switch in on and pressure physical attackers. It can also come in easily on threats like Mienfoo, Pawniard, Snivy, and Snubbull. Additionally, reliable recovery in Morning Sun strengthens its role and increases its longevity. However, Larvesta has a few devastating flaws; namely, it is 4x weak to Stealth Rock and Rock-type coverage, such as Diglett's Rock Slide and Mienfoo's Stone Edge. It is also weak to common types like Flying and Water. It faces competition as a physical Fire-type from Ponyta, which is faster and less weak to Stealth Rock. Larvesta needs entry hazard removal to function, as otherwise it becomes dead weight. Finally, it rests at an awkward Speed tier and is unable to outspeed many of its foes, namely Doduo and Staryu.", "Solrock": "Solrock is overwhelmed by its competition as a Stealth Rock setter from Pokemon such as Regirock, Mesprit, and Bronzor. This is all majorly because of Solrock's mediocre stats compared to their great bulk and other attributes like better defensive typings. While its Rock / Psychic typing may seem good at first, the two occasionally contrast and make Solrock unable to reliably switch into certain Pokemon Regirock and Mesprit can like Skuntank and Poliwrath.", "Aegislash": null, "Woobat": "Although Woobat has a niche in its unique ability Simple, allowing it to double the boosts from Calm Mind and quickly make Stored Power threatening, it has several gaping flaws; in particular, it has a mediocre typing, lacking bulk, and a weakness to the plethora of viable Dark-types in the tier, such as Pawniard, Vullaby, and Alolan Grimer. Additionally, Woobat's reliance on setting up Calm Mind to pose an offensive threat means it is often outclassed by more consistent Psychic-type sweepers such as Abra.", "Leavanny": "Due its decent Speed stat, offensive presence, and useful support moves, Leavanny stands out as the most reliable Sticky Web user in PU. Leavanny's decent Attack stat, good STAB moves, and Bug / Grass typing give it a good matchup against common Stealth Rock users in PU such as Golurk, Mesprit, Regirock, and Carracosta, and access to Knock Off lets Leavanny cripple Pokemon holding items like Eviolite and Leftovers. Leavanny also gets Magic Coat, which lets it bounce back entry hazards and status moves such as Taunt and Encore against foes like Sableye and Liepard. However, Leavanny's bad defensive typing, Stealth Rock weakness, and average bulk make it very easy to wear down, which means it can't keep up Sticky Web reliably during the match. Leavanny's typing also makes it weak to common Defoggers such as Skuntank and Swanna. Leavanny is overall a niche pick, as it lacks value outside of being a Sticky Web user.", "Trevenant": "Trevenant is outclassed in many ways by offensive Grass-types such as Leafeon and Alolan Exeggutor, Ghost-types like Golurk, and Gourgeist-XL in any defensive sets due to Gourgeist-XL's far better defenses and reliable recovery. Trevenant's competition as an attacker all have notable qualities over it such as a better Speed tier and Swords Dance, a superior secondary typing, or Stealth Rock, respectively. Even with Trevenant\u2019s access to Natural Cure and Trick, it is not enough to warrant its usage, especially when it's pressured by Pursuit more than its competition.", "Sealeo": null, "Bergmite": "While Bergmite might seem like a good defensive spinner thanks to its high physical bulk and access to Recover, its typing dashes any hope it has of being viable. Being a pure Ice-type, Bergmite is weak to many common offensive Pokemon in LC, such as Timburr and Ponyta, as well as the Stealth Rock it's supposed to remove. Its poor special bulk and lack of any significant offensive pressure isn't doing it any favors either. Staryu is a much better option for a Rapid Spinner, as it has a much better typing and better offensive prowess as well as access to Recover.", "Clamperl": "Thanks to Clamperl's exclusive item Deep Sea Tooth, it can reach an insane 34 Special Attack. Using Shell Smash allows Clamperl to outspeed the entire unboosted LC metagame while also skyrocketing its Special Attack stat. However, Clamperl is quite frail, which makes it quite hard to set up a Shell Smash. Additionally, after it has used Shell Smash, its lowered defensive stats leave it incredibly vulnerable to priority attacks. It is also outclassed by Omanyte, which has a better typing, is less reliant on having a specific item, and is bulkier, allowing for easier set up. However, Clamperl does hit far harder and, unlike Omanyte, is not weak to Mach Punch or Vacuum Wave, which is more important than Omanyte's resistance to Flying-type attacks now that Gale Wings has been nerfed.", "Octillery": "Octillery might appear to possess some potential with its good Special Attack and vast movepool, but its middling Speed and lackluster bulk gives it a more difficult time to switch in safely. Octillery faces overwhelming competition from Ludicolo and Choice Specs Jellicent as Water-type wallbreakers due to them having far more opportunities to switch in by virtue of their secondary typings. Octillery can only use its poor Speed to its advantage in the niche archetype of Trick Room, but it even faces competition there from Wishiwashi, which has better bulk and humongous Special Attack that invalidates multiple niches that Octillery could have.", "Electabuzz": null, "Venonat": null, "Treecko": "Treecko has a unique niche on offensive teams thanks to its Unburden ability. This allows Treecko to set up Swords Dance, usually take a hit, and consume Berry Juice afterward, thus doubling its Speed and becoming a threatening late-game sweeper. Alongside Treecko's fantastic ability and access to Swords Dance are plenty of useful coverage options, including Acrobatics, Drain Punch, and Rock Slide. Unfortunately, Treecko is extremely frail with a poor defensive typing and is thus vulnerable to super effective attacks, powerful offensive Pokemon, and strong priority. Treecko is also extremely weak before a Swords Dance boost, meaning that it is quite reliant on the move to do any notable damage. It can still struggle to break past some bulky threats after a boost, such as Spritzee, Vullaby, Mareanie, and Foongus, as it isn't extremely powerful even after using Swords Dance. Unburden can also be a rather situational ability in that it only activates once, meaning that upon setting up, Treecko will put itself in an all-or-nothing situation. Treecko also suffers from a slight case of four-moveslot syndrome, as its choice of coverage will either prevent it from hurting Fire- and Poison-types if it uses Acrobatics or from hurting Grass- and Fighting-types if it uses Rock Slide. Lastly, the strenuous team support Treecko requires to sweep can cause the teams built around it to be matchup reliant.", "Pumpkaboo": null, "Pikachu": null, "Zoroark": "Despite having a unique signature ability in Illusion, Zoroark is an unviable choice in the metagame. It has poor bulk and faces absurd amounts of competition from the likes of Hydreigon and Mega Houndoom, both of which sport dual typings and are stronger Dark-type attackers right off the bat. In addition, Zoroark sits at an unfortunate Speed tier where prevalent Pokemon like Cobalion, Terrakion, and Latias can easily revenge kill it. Illusion is also one-time use and can scouted for through entry hazards, making Zoroark's only defining trait far less useful in practice.", "Jynx": "Jynx stands out in PU as a dangerous and effective sweeper and wallbreaker thanks to its access to the incredible Z-Lovely Kiss as well as Nasty Plot, which allows it to boost its Speed and Special Attack while putting foes to sleep. Its excellent dual STAB combination allows Jynx to forgo coverage if it needs to, although Focus Blast is a great option for getting neutral coverage on the entire tier. Jynx also has decent set diversity, with its Choice Scarf and Substitute sets being able to catch foes off guard. Dry Skin gives Jynx even more utility, allowing it to check a plethora of Water-types in the tier including Poliwrath and Floatzel. However, Jynx has awful defenses and a terrible defensive typing, leaving it susceptible to most forms of priority and all entry hazards. While its Speed tier is decent, it still leaves Jynx open to being revenge killed by a number of threats, including a few notable Choice Scarf users such as Pyroar even when Jynx is at +1. Finally, Jynx can have difficulty with Lovely Kiss's accuracy and the prevalence of other base 95 Speed Pokemon, which can lead to very common Speed ties with foes such as Primeape.", "Galvantula": "Galvantula is the strongest Sticky Web user in the RU tier and is able to threaten some common entry hazard removers like Mantine and Mandibuzz. It also sports a high Speed tier and a strong STAB combination of Thunder and Bug Buzz, allowing it to be an offensive threat to teams that rely on Grass-types to tank Electric-type moves. Its good offensive presence allows it to fit on teams that aren't fully reliant on Sticky Web as well, giving it the edge over other Sticky Web setters. However, its mediocre base 97 Special Attack means that it is reliant on Life Orb for good damage output. Furthermore, Galvantula is frail and has a mediocre defensive typing, which means it struggles to switch in safely; this frailty also makes it difficult for Galvantula to keep Sticky Web up reliably. It is also beaten by some entry hazard removers that can outlast or KO it, particularly Florges, while Choice Scarf Defog Flygon can outspeed and remove Galvantula's Sticky Webs.", "Manaphy": "Manaphy is a powerful wallbreaker that is capable of easily breaking apart defensively oriented teams with Tail Glow, which boosts its Special Attack to incredible levels. It also boasts decent natural bulk and a good defensive typing in mono-Water, which grants it many opportunities to set up. To top it off, Manaphy has access to a number of excellent coverage moves such as Energy Ball, Ice Beam, and Psychic that allow it to customize its moveset to break through some of its traditional checks and counters. However, Manaphy suffers from significant four-moveslot syndrome, as it's unable to fit all the options it wants to run on one set. Additionally, its base 100 Speed tier, although decent, makes it largely ineffective versus offensively oriented teams.", "Hitmonchan": "Hitmonchan's constant offensive presence and good utility options let it provide it solid role compression. Its utility lies in its access to Rapid Spin combined with its ability to pressure Stealth Rock users such as Carracosta and Regirock, and it can act as a blanket check to many of the tier's special attackers due to its considerable amount of Special Defense that can be further augmented by Assault Vest. Offensively, Iron Fist is Hitmonchan's premier ability, as the boost provides it solid damage output on all of its attacking moves, including its strong priority in Mach Punch. It can also utilize Life Orb to drastically increase its damage output and help it KO Pokemon like Jynx and Omastar with Mach Punch. All of these traits allow Hitmonchan to provide an exceptional amount of utility for teams while being an immediate threat, and although it lacks recovery, it can circumstantially mitigate this with its main attacking move, Drain Punch.", "Numel": "Numel can turn into a powerful sweeper with its amazing ability Simple, doubling the magnitude of stat changes, which is complemented by its movepool with access to boosting moves like Flame Charge and Growth and powerful STAB options like Fire Blast and Earth Power. Numel also boasts a great typing, being able to check common Grass-, Steel-, and Fire-types like Ferroseed, Magnemite, and Larvesta and sporting an immunity to Thunder Wave as well as a near-unresisted STAB combination. However, this typing leaves Numel with two weaknesses to common types in Ground and Water, making it vulnerable to Diglett before a Flame Charge boost and extremely weak to Aqua Jet from the likes of Corphish and Tirtouga. Numel is also quite slow before a Flame Charge boost, meaning it's susceptible to faster Pokemon, and even with a Flame Charge boost, it is still outsped by fast Choice Scarf users such as Doduo and Gastly. It's not very strong before a Growth boost either, meaning it requires both boosts to be really effective, which will rarely happen in a match because of how fast paced and offensive the LC metagame is. Lastly, Numel faces competition from Ponyta and Larvesta as an offensive Fire-type due to their reliability, with Ponyta sporting recovery and a better Speed stat and Larvesta being able to pivot while sporting a Fighting-type resistance.", "Bunnelby": "Bunnelby is able to use Huge Power to effectively wallbreak and clean. Aditionally, its decent Speed in conjunction with a Choice Scarf or Sticky Web support allow it to outspeed many important threats and effectively revenge kill as well. Due to its high Attack and coverage it is hard to switch into, but some common Pokemon, such as Onix, Ferroseed, and Pumpkaboo-XL can still easily come in. Additionally, Fighting-types such as Timburr and Mienfoo can easily force Bunnelby out, forcing Bunnelby's team to lose some momentum, and if it is being run on an offensive team, that can be hard to deal with. Finally, it has very low bulk, meaning it is very hard to get it in without U-turn or Volt Switch.", "Clefable": "Clefable's decent bulk along with its great defensive typing allows it to serve as a strong check to attackers such as Mega Medicham, Mega Heracross, Hawlucha, and Mega Lopunny a role that it can perform well due to its reliable recovery in Soft-Boiled. Its ability to act as a strong defensive threat is bolstered by its two amazing abilities in Magic Guard and Unaware that allow Clefable to avoid all residual damage or act as a stop to setup sweepers, respectively. Magic Guard Clefable brings great utility for its teammates as a Stealth Rock setter that has a great matchup against Mega Sableye, easing the matchup against stall teams, or as a strong Calm Mind sweeper. On the other hand, Unaware Clefable is able to stop many setup sweepers that defensive teams would normally have issues dealing with such as Swords Dance Hawlucha and Swords Dance Garchomp. However, despite its decent bulk, Clefable can find itself overwhelmed by attackers that it normally can check provided that it has taken prior damage as well as by strong attackers such as Ash-Greninja that are able to pressure it too much for it to perform its roles efficiently. In addition, due to its low Speed, Clefable is very susceptible to Taunt users such as Heatran and Tapu Lele, which prevent it from providing utility for its team. One of Clefable's main downsides is the fact that due to its lacklustre offensive presence, it invites very threatening wallbreakers like Heatran, Mega Mawile, and Volcarona.", "Cherubi": "Cherubi is only ever used on sun teams to support the team's main Chlorophyll sweeper, which is usually Bellsprout. Unfortunately, with Vulpix's ban sun has dropped dramatically in viability to the point where even this tiny niche isn't enough to make it viable. That's not even mentioning the other Chlorophyll sweepers such as Bulbasaur and Oddish, which outclass Cherubi even on sun, and Snivy, which is the better option everywhere else, meaning Cherubi should not be used on any serious team.", "Fletchling": "With a good ability and a relatively good movepool, Fletchling theoretically should be one of the best revenge killers in Little Cup as well as a good setup sweeper. Its relatively good offensive stats help it even more with this. However, it's held back by a weakness to Stealth Rock and is mostly outclassed by the many other good Flying-types in the tier. Although it is a shadow of its former self, it still has a niche as a sweeper and revenge killer with its good priority.", "Qwilfish": "Qwilfish is one of the best Spikes and Toxic Spikes setters in the tier thanks to its decent physical bulk, great defensive typing, and ability Intimidate letting it set entry hazards more easily and blanket check common attackers such as Hitmonchan and Skuntank. It also has access to several other utility options such as Taunt, Destiny Bond, and Thunder Wave, giving it versatility outside of being an entry hazard setter. Qwilfish can also function as a sweeper on rain teams thanks to Swords Dance, a STAB combination only resisted by other Qwilfish, and the ability to absorb Toxic Spikes, a great annoyance to rain builds. However, it lacks reliable recovery, leaving it susceptible to chip damage from hazards and from repeatedly switching into Pokemon it has to check, such as Kangaskhan. Qwilfish's special bulk is rather awful, leaving it vulnerable to special attackers such as Swanna and Eelektross. Even with a near-unresisted STAB combination, Qwilfish can be passive at times, as Scald is rather weak coming off of its feeble Special Attack, and even its physical moves don't hit too hard without investment. On its Swords Dance set, it lacks immediate power compared to other sweepers such as Kabutops and usually relies on rain or a boost to break through walls such as Mesprit. Regardless, Qwilfish's immense utility, decent Speed, and offensive presence under rain make it a top pick for many teams.", "Jangmo-o": "Jangmo-o's access to Dragon Dance allows it to function as a late-game sweeper and cleaner on offensive teams. Its ability Bulletproof lets it check some Gastly and Croagunk variants and set up with Dragon Dance. Furthermore, Jangmo-o's useful resistances to Fire, Water, Grass, and Electric can help it find setup opportunities at times. However, it faces serious competition from other Dragon Dance cleaners such as Axew and Dratini; the former has better stats, and the latter has access to Extreme Speed to aid it in cleaning. Also, Jangmo-o finds it difficult to set up, as it's frail, weak, and slow, and consequently heavily reliant on team support. Finally, it struggles with Fairy-types such as Snubbull and Spritzee due to lack of super effective coverage to hit them with.", "Latias": "Latias's combination of typing, good offensive stats, bulk, coverage, and reliable recovery makes it one of the most dangerous and metagame-defining offensive presences in the tier. Access to Calm Mind as well as multiple usable Z-Moves takes this offensive prowess to the next level, allowing it to break through the majority of its potential checks, all while capitalizing on the defensive utility afforded by its good typing and high bulk for a fast offensive Pokemon. It also has access to key support moves in Defog and Healing Wish to allow it to serve certain utility purposes as needed. All of this versatility makes Latias extremely flexible and team friendly and forces opponents to be on their toes until Latias has revealed its set to gauge their response accordingly. The tier has responded to Latias's presence, however, with a wide array of offensive and defensive counterplay: most faster Pokemon can heavily damage or outright KO it, it is vulnerable to common priority users like Scizor, Mamoswine, and Bisharp, and perhaps most importantly, it is weak to Pursuit from trappers such as Mega Aerodactyl and Krookodile. Furthermore, despite Latias's key resistances letting it exploit a good number of Pokemon, Dragon / Psychic does have its flaws as a defensive typing, as with six common weaknesses, Latias is forced out or Pursuit trapped by a large portion of the tier depending on its set. It is also heavily reliant on Z-Moves and the easily punishable Draco Meteor to do significant damage, as it is rather weak unboosted and can be easily pressured to fire off predictable attacks. Lastly, Latias's STAB combination is walled by Steel-types, meaning that it must either burn its Z-Move or sacrifice one of Calm Mind, Roost, or a Psychic-type attack to stand a chance against the likes of Empoleon, Mega Aggron, and Klefki on its own. These shortcomings open up Latias to relatively straightforward methods to minimize its impact on the game, meaning that while it is rare for any Latias set to be dead weight in a given matchup, there are many in which it will not be as devastating as it might otherwise be.", "Claydol": "Claydol has somewhat of a niche in its access to both Rapid Spin and Stealth Rock. While it's not the only viable Pokemon to get both of these moves, it has other advantages such as its typing; Ground / Psychic is solid defensively and allows Claydol to serve as a switch-in for Pokemon such as Lycanroc and Manectric, notably serving as a Volt Switch stopper. It also gives Claydol a notable niche in being both resistant to Stealth Rock and immune to all other entry hazards thanks to Levitate. Finally, its typing also gives Claydol a good offensive matchup against various hazard setters and removers such as Aggron and Hitmonchan. However, while it does have great defensive stats, its HP is pretty bad, giving it a hard time taking too many hits, especially with its lack of recovery. Its offensive presence is very mediocre, preventing it from picking up many OHKOs such as Earth Power on Skuntank and leaving it as setup fodder for Pokemon such as Lilligant and Calm Mind Clefairy. While its typing is good in various ways, it gives Claydol a bad matchup against spinblockers such as Froslass and Oricorio-G, as well as against common offensive Pokemon such as Lilligant and Ludicolo. Alolan Sandslash is rightfully the more popular pick for a Pokemon with both Rapid Spin and Stealth Rock. This is because of its better defensive typing that allows it to wall more offensive threats such as Aurorus and Lilligant. Furthermore, even if they don't have access to Rapid Spin, Pokemon such as Mudsdale and Regirock outclass Claydol as a Stealth Rock user with their better bulk. The same can be said with Rapid Spin users such as Hitmonchan and Kabutops due to their better offensive presence.", "Sudowoodo": "Sudowoodo's access to the coveted combination of Head Smash and Rock Head may seem appealing at first, but this attribute is also shared with Aggron, which is far better due to its secondary typing, Speed, power, and bulk. Other Rock-types such as Carracosta and Lycanroc possess setup moves and have more reliable priority than Sudowoodo. While it does possess some interesting moves such as Wood Hammer and Sucker Punch, Sudowoodo lacks anything to prevent it from being outclassed from its superior Rock-type brethren in PU due to its terrible Speed and average power.", "Starmie": "Starmie is an excellent offensive Pokemon thanks to its great coverage options and useful ability Analytic, and it is also the fastest Rapid Spin user in the tier. In addition to having great offensive capabilities, it also has adequate tools such as Natural Cure, Recover, and Reflect Type that let it viably run a bulkier set geared more towards support. Starmie's Speed tier is fantastic, letting it outspeed many offensive threats like Latias, Terrakion, and Infernape. However, Starmie's raw power without boosts is lacking due to its middling base 100 Special Attack, which can cause it some trouble in breaking past bulkier Pokemon such as Sylveon and Snorlax. This is much more apparent when using bulky variants of Starmie with no Special Attack investment, making these variants unfortunately rather passive versus targets that do not care about burns. While its Water / Psychic typing gives it some useful resistances that allow it to act as a soft check to Pokemon such as Infernape and Cobalion, Starmie is moderately frail, which means that without investment it will not be able to switch in on even many resisted hits. Its typing also gives it a very serious weakness to Electric-, Bug-, Dark-, Ghost-, and Grass-type attacks, which leaves it extremely vulnerable to strategies such as Pursuit trapping and VoltTurn.", "Chinchou": "Chinchou is one of the best pivots in Little Cup with a superb typing that makes it only weak to Grass and Ground; even then, with STAB Volt Switch it doesn't mind attacking the former, and with Scald doesn't mind the latter very much either. Its ability Volt Absorb also makes it a reliable check to Electric-types such as Magnemite and opposing Chinchou. It is also one of the few Pokemon able to reliably check the many offensive Flying-types of Little Cup, primarily the likes of Vullaby and Doduo. However, its defensive sets can be too passive and its offensive sets can be too frail. It also has no reliable recovery besides Rest and Berry Juice.", "Steelix": "Mega Steelix is a great tank that takes advantage of its great bulk, good typing, and high Attack to check prominent threats like Latias, Heal Bell Togekiss, and Klefki. Coupled with access to Stealth Rock, these traits differentiate Mega Steelix from other Stealth Rock setters such as Nihilego and Hippowdon. Mega Steelix's Ground typing allows it to block Volt Switch, which gives it leverage over other Steel-types like Cobalion and Stakataka. That said, Mega Steelix still suffers from heavy competition with Mega Aggron, which has access to Filter and has more resistances. Furthermore, despite having eight resistances, Mega Steelix suffers from a weakness to common types including Fighting, Water, and Ground, which leaves it weak to other prominent threats, including Terrakion, Primarina, and Hippowdon. Mega Steelix's lack of reliable recovery also lessens its reliability, as it is forced to be paired with Wish support if it desires to reach its full potential as a wall. While Mega Steelix's low Speed increases Gyro Ball's damage output, it also leaves Mega Steelix outsped by the vast majority of the metagame, which means it'll have to take a hit before moving in most cases. Finally, despite its Ground typing, Mega Steelix struggles to reliably check common Electric-types like Mega Manectric and Rotom-H because they can hit it super effectively. Hence, other Ground-types like Hippowdon and Swampert outperform Mega Steelix in this role.", "Lunala": null, "Phanpy": "Despite its access to useful moves such as Knock Off and Ice Shard, Phanpy is unviable in the Little Cup metagame because it is directly outclassed by Mudbray, due to its better overall stats and ability in Stamina. Phanpy is weak and slow, and its Special Defense is horrible, which is something Abra, Snivy, and Omanyte can exploit.", "Ninetales": "Ninetales is a threatening wallbreaker thanks to its Drought ability and ability to threaten switch ins with Nasty Plot or Choice Specs. It also gets great coverage Solar Beam to beat Water- and Rock-types and Hidden Power Ice for Noivern and Flygon. Also, Drought combined with its good special bulk makes Ninetales more effective against Water-types than any of its competitors. However, while Ninetales has decent Speed, it still is vulnerable to faster attackers such as Zygarde-10% and Choice Scarf Tyrantrum, which can revenge kill it. Ninetales also faces stiff competition from similar attackers like Salazzle, which can also utilize Nasty Plot and has better Speed, better Special Attack, and a secondary type for coverage.", "Gulpin": null, "Azumarill": "Azumarill is a decent sweeper in the OU metagame with the combination of Belly Drum, Aqua Jet, and its ability Huge Power. Its access to Knock Off also allows it muscle past common defensive Pokemon such as Toxapex and Ferrothorn at +6. Azumarill's Water / Fairy typing offers excellent STAB coverage and useful resistances to Dragon-, Dark-, Fire-, and Fighting-type attacks, which gives it plenty of setup opportunities. Unfortunately, Azumarill suffers from a lackluster Speed stat, which, despite its adequate natural bulk, leaves it vulnerable to faster Aqua Jet resists such as Kartana, Kyurem-B, Mega Venusaur, and Tapu Bulu. The prevalence of Psychic Terrain can also be a problem for Azumarill, as its low Speed will frequently force it to rely on using Aqua Jet.", "Glalie": "Mega Glalie is a potent wallbreaker thanks to its powerful Refrigerate-boosted STAB moves, solid offensive stats, and near-unresisted coverage between its Ice- and Ground-type attacks. Mega Glalie is also an excellent user of Spikes, as its ability to break past entry hazard removers such as Golbat, Silvally-Steel, and Dhelmise as well as threaten Xatu allows it to easily set them up and keep them on the field. A great Speed tier significantly bolsters Mega Glalie's matchup against offensive teams, letting it get the jump on a plethora of unboosted offensive Pokemon like Magmortar, Rotom, and Sigilyph. Unfortunately, Mega Glalie's mediocre bulk and defensive typing hold it back, as it sports weaknesses to common Fire-, Fighting-, and Steel-types such as Incineroar, Passimian, and Steelix. In particular, its weakness to all entry hazards in conjunction with Double-Edge's recoil makes Mega Glalie easy to wear down, leaving it susceptible to revenge killers such as Sceptile, Heliolisk, and Choice Scarf Passimian. Mega Glalie also struggles to break through common defensive Water-types such as Slowking, Vaporeon, and Blastoise given their resistance to Double-Edge and the negligible damage they take from Earthquake.", "Camerupt": "Camerupt's Fire / Ground typing provides a valuable immunity to Electric-type moves and a resistance to Fairy-type moves, which, along with its solid bulk, allows Mega Camerupt to function as an effective check to Electric-types such as Tapu Koko and Mega Manectric and Fairy-types such as Magearna and Mega Mawile. Access to extremely powerful Fire- and Ground-type STAB moves is very useful too, as it allows Mega Camerupt to shred common Pokemon found on bulky offense teams such as Celesteela, Tangrowth, Toxapex, Mew, and Ferrothorn. Fire-resistant Pokemon aren't very common in the metagame either, with many teams relying on the likes of Greninja and Keldeo, which are very shaky answers to Mega Camerupt, while others such as Tyranitar and Heatran can't switch into Mega Camerupt reliably because of the threat of Earth Power. Mega Camerupt does struggle in the metagame, however, mostly due to its low Speed, which forces it to take a hit before it can attack back; this also often leads to it being very prediction reliant. On top of this, Ground- and Water-types such as Ash-Greninja, Garchomp, Gliscor, and Rotom-W are all common in the metagame.", "Jirachi": "Jirachi's above average bulk and great defensive typing give it a place in OU as one of the metagame's most consistent and reliable checks to Magearna, Tapu Lele, and Mega Alakazam while still packing plenty of Speed with Choice Scarf sets. Healing Wish is also an extremely valuable tool for bulky offense archetypes, giving the likes of Mega Charizard X and Volcarona a second shot a sweeping. Jirachi is no slouch offensively either, as courtesy of Serene Grace and Choice Scarf, Iron Head can pose a threat to several weakened or unprepared teams. Defensive sets can also be good picks on a handful of teams, notably providing Wish support and a near impenetrable counter to Tapu Lele, Mega Alakazam, and Magearna. Unfortunately, despite Jirachi's good typing, it is vulnerable to the tier's ever-present Ground-types in Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Gliscor and Fire-types like Heatran and Volcarona, as well as having a fearful weakness to Knock Off. Choice Scarf Jirachi can also struggle at times due to its rather average Speed and power and being pressured to U-turn not to lose momentum, which the opponent can and will take advantage of, whereas defensive sets also lose plenty of momentum naturally.", "Mareanie": "Mareanie's fantastic defensive ability in Regenerator alongside its decent mixed bulk, access to reliable recovery, and typing allow it to function on balanced and defensive teams as a stellar defensive pivot as well as a reliable check to common threats in Mienfoo, Vullaby, Alolan Grimer, and more. Furthermore, Mareanie's expansive utility movepool, consisting of useful options in Haze, Toxic Spikes, and Scald, allows it to discourage setup sweepers and inflict foes with status to stall them out. Despite these perks, Mareanie's poor offensive stats make it quite passive, and its merely decent bulk still leaves it susceptible to the tier's common Electric- and Ground-type attacks as well as especially powerful wallbreakers in Abra and Gastly.", "Joltik": "Joltik boasts a useful array of moves such as Giga Drain as well as a unique typing that gives it a resistance to Fighting-type moves. Nevertheless, its lackluster Special Attack and Stealth Rock weakness results in Joltik not being a good choice for a team. Joltik is outclassed by Magnemite and Elekid as strong special attackers that are more efficient throughout games.", "Poipole": null, "Hydreigon": "Hydreigon is a premier special attacker in UU thanks to its exceptional power and respectable Speed tier. Its spammable STAB combination, great coverage, and access to a few different utility options allow it to viably run a plethora of sets, including Choice Scarf, Choice Specs, and a stallbreaking set that utilizes Taunt. Hydreigon also has respectable bulk for an offensive Pokemon, with resistances that allow it to easily take on Pokemon like Chandelure, Mega Houndoom, and Gligar. Moreover, its access to Defog allows it to function as a reliable offensive entry hazard remover that can clear hazards when it forces switches. However, Hydreigon's typing also provides it with weaknesses to common types in Bug, Fighting, and especially Fairy, which can at times limit its opportunities to switch in. Hydreigon is also weak to priority attacks like Mach Punch and Vacuum Wave, which can allow the likes of Infernape and Lucario to pick it off with some prior damage. Lastly, Hydreigon suffers from the presence of faster threats despite its decent Speed tier, meaning that Pokemon such as Latias, Cobalion, and Mega Beedrill can easily outrun non-Choice Scarf sets and force Hydreigon out.", "Wingull": null, "Golisopod": "Golisopod is a fearsome wallbreaker due to its great STAB combination and access to Spikes to pressure switch-ins with chip damage. It's also a premium revenge killer, since it has amazing priority in First Impression to OHKO fast setup sweepers and offensive threats like Virizion, Gardevoir, and Barbaracle. A good Defense stat and a nice set of resistances let it check Ground-types such as Donphan, Zygarde-10%, and Flygon. It can also deal with the likes of Medicham due to its resistance to Fighting and soft check Water-types such as Mega Blastoise and Araquanid. Despite the effectiveness of Golisopod\u2019s STAB moves, it can also run coverage moves to beat Pokemon that resist it STAB combination, such as Rock Slide to beat Noivern and Drill Run to beat Dragalge and Toxicroak. Unfortunately, Golisopod is cursed with Emergency Exit. While it can some times be useful, getting forced out is most often detrimental. This, plus the fact that Stealth Rock and other residual damage wear it down quickly, can prevent Golisopod from switching into Pokemon such as Steelix and Donphan. While First Impression can hit like a truck, its restriction to first-turn use can turn Golisopod into setup bait for Pokemon like Feraligatr, Linoone, and Barbaracle. Also, since it's Golisopod's most common move, it can usually be played around by the opponent through pivoting and the use of Protect, which forces Golisopod out when it's running Choice Band. Since it commonly will be locked into one move, Golisopod can be usually checked by offensive threats that don't mind its STAB combination, such as Bewear and Toxicroak. A bad Speed tier of base 40 leaves Golisopod vulnerable even to slow Pokemon such as Mega Ampharos and Emboar. Golisopod's standard set can also be walled by common bulky Water-types, such as Milotic.", "Carracosta": "Carracosta is a huge threat that can be either an incredibly powerful offensive sweeper with Shell Smash or a defensive wall. Respectable attacking stats and a good movepool make Carracosta a versatile mixed attacker, and its large Defense stat along with good defensive Water / Rock typing gives Carracosta plenty of opportunities to set up against a large number of potential threats such as Type: Null. Meanwhile, the defensive wall set effectively utilizes Carracosta's natural bulk, good defensive typing, and myriad of support options to absorb Fire-, Flying-, and Normal-type attacks. However, low Speed, low Special Defense, and a large number of weaknesses\u2014most notably a 4x Grass weakness\u2014mean that Carracosta can be easily exploited and taken down by a number of threats like Alolan Raichu and Gourgeist-XL.", "Gallade": "Mega Gallade is a decent wallbreaker thanks to its high Attack stat paired with its strong STAB moves and useful coverage moves in Knock Off and Ice Punch. Having access to Swords Dance allows Mega Gallade to boost its Attack stat to even higher levels, which can make it difficult for defensive teams to take on. Knock Off is particularly useful for pressuring bulky Psychic-types that other Fighting-types such as Mega Medicham tend to struggle with. Mega Gallade's good Speed tier allows it to outspeed foes such as Kartana, Garchomp, Mega Medicham, and Tapu Lele, giving it an edge against some offensive teams. Its decent bulk, notably in Special Defense, gives it setup opportunities against a majority of defensive Pokemon. It also allows Mega Gallade to take a hit from certain offensive threats in a pinch. Unfortunately, it faces competition from other Fighting-types like Mega Medicham, which doesn't rely on setup in order to beat bulkier teams, and Mega Heracross, which has an easier time against stall teams as well as a more useful defensive typing. Despite the fact that its bulk isn't terrible, Mega Gallade's poor defensive typing means it's still prone to being revenge killed by a bunch of common faster Pokemon such as Tornadus-T as well as most Choice Scarf users; this is especially true after a Defense drop from Close Combat.", "Staryu": "Staryu is one of the best entry hazard removers in Little Cup thanks to its great Speed, good typing, and cool coverage. Though it competes with Defog users such as Vullaby, being able to maintain allied entry hazards when using Rapid Spin is an important advantage. Additionally, the combination of Hydro Pump and Analytic makes Staryu's offensive sets even more potent. All of these factors combine to make Staryu a great partner for hazard-fearing Pokemon such as Ponyta and Doduo and an overall excellent glue Pokemon.", "Heliolisk": "Heliolisk is one of NU's most potent wallbreakers as a result of its stellar offensive typing, high Special Attack, and great Speed tier that allows it to outpace some of the most common Pokemon in the tier in Delphox, Decidueye, and Sigilyph. Heliolisk is also one of the tier's best offensive pivots because of its access to a strong Volt Switch, which is hard to stop due to Heliolisk's impressive coverage in moves such as Hyper Voice, Surf, and Focus Blast. Because of the aforementioned factors, Heliolisk can easily avoid most forms of direct damage and pivot out of unfavorable matchups. Due to Dry Skin, Heliolisk is able to switch into Water-type moves and regain HP, making it the tier's premier bulky Water-type exploiter. However, Heliolisk's bulk is rather poor, especially physically, which makes it harder to switch in on weaker, resisted attacks and on defensive Water-types such as Slowking due to its access to Psyshock. While Heliolisk's Speed tier is solid, it is still outsped and forced out by Pokemon such as Sneasel and Whimsicott. Heliolisk is reliant on its item for its damage output, with Choice Specs variants being locked into one move, which can lead to them being taken advantage of by Pokemon like Dhelmise and Steelix depending on which move it locks into.", "Weezing": "Weezing differentiates itself from other defensive Poison-types such as Garbodor and Golbat due to its access to Levitate, which lets it check Ground-types such as Steelix and Rhydon without a weakness to Spikes. Additionally, Weezing's Poison typing allows it to check both Fighting- and Grass-type Pokemon such as Passimian, Decidueye, and Sceptile. Weezing's access to the combination of Will-O-Wisp and Taunt lets it be effective against more defensive teams. Unfortunately, Weezing faces heavy competition for the spot of a bulky Poison-type from Pokemon like Vileplume and Golbat, which have better Special Defense stats, allowing them to better check specially offensive Grass-types such as Whimsicott and Sceptile, as well as having access to more reliable recovery moves such as Strength Sap and Roost.", "Swoobat": "Swoobat has two unique niches in its ability Simple and its blistering high Speed stat. With the capability to boost quickly, Swoobat's Special Attack skyrockets to absurd levels even after just one Calm Mind. Swoobat doesn't mind taking chip damage as much as other Pokemon, since it will be purposefully reducing its own health with Substitute, although the inability to use Substitute at low HP can be annoying. Not everything is that simple, however, as these niches come at the cost of being very predictable. Due to its extreme frailty, Swoobat will generally be KOed in one hit. It needs immense team support, like dual screens or Memento, to function properly. Swoobat's frailty also means that it is vulnerable to priority attacks such as Skuntank's Sucker Punch. Furthermore, Swoobat's dual typing overlaps weaknesses with several top-tier threats such as Mesprit, Aurorus, and Kingler. This, combined with its frailty and need for team support, makes it somewhat difficult to add while teambuilding. Swoobat is also over-reliant on setting up with Calm Mind, as otherwise it's left with a 20-Base Power Stored Power.", "Mareep": "With horrible base stats and an incredibly limited movepool, Mareep finds itself with no use whatsoever in Little Cup. Although it can set both Reflect and Light Screen for its allies and remove status with Heal Bell, there are better Pokemon that set dual screens, such as Alolan Vulpix with its Aurora Veil or Voltorb. It is also bait for setup sweepers, who can take advantage of Mareep's passiveness and burn through the dual screens with ease with their boosted stats.", "Salazzle": "In a sea of lower-tier Fire-types, Salazzle stands out as one of the most lethal among them and one of the most powerful RU Pokemon. Its excellent STAB combination, great Speed, and access to Nasty Plot give it the means to pose as a threatening sweeper to every playstyle, and its great typing makes up for its minuscule defenses by granting it crucial 4x resistances and a Toxic immunity, which allow it to set up on Pokemon like Florges, Roserade, Registeel, and single-attack or Choice-locked Escavalier. Salazzle's defensive typing serves other purposes as well by diluting the threat of Toxic Spikes and letting it serve as an offensive check to Chlorophyll Venusaur and Synthesis Virizion. Salazzle is also a notable user of Z-Moves, using its Acid Downpour to its fullest by melting through a slew of tenacious specially defensive Pokemon such as Snorlax, Diancie, Milotic, and Cresselia with minimal support. Salazzle's frailty and Stealth Rock weakness result in it being a tad too easy to revenge kill with priority such as Sucker Punch or any ordinary Choice Scarf user, however. Salazzle's lack of bulk also restricts setup opportunities to forced switches and specific targets, and even then, due to Salazzle's limited coverage options, it requires additional support to break through the likes of Gigalith.", "Spiritomb": "Spiritomb's good defensive typing, which gives it three useful immunities to Fighting, Psychic, and Normal, decent bulk, and access to a fairly solid support movepool with moves like Will-O-Wisp, Taunt, and Calm Mind give it great defensive presence. Spiritomb is also capable of providing useful offensive support to teams threatened by Pokemon like Mesprit, Haunter, and Oricorio-G due to its access to a fairly strong Pursuit and Sucker Punch, giving its Pursuit Trapper set a good mix of attributes. Spiritomb is also capable of acting as a bulky setup sweeper on bulkier teams because of its access to Calm Mind. However, Spiritomb's solid mixed bulk is offset by its low HP, and its lack of reliable recovery in tandem with its vulnerability to entry hazards only makes wearing it down easier, which can hurt its longevity in longer matches. Calm Mind Spiritomb is forced to rely on Rest for recovery, which can be taken advantage of by strong attackers like Stoutland. Spiritomb's low Speed also tends to leave it more reliant on Sucker Punch than it would like to be, which can be capitalized on by setup sweepers such as Lilligant.", "Reshiram": null, "Paras": "Paras is weak, frail, slow, and cursed with a poor typing that leaves it weak to common Ice-, Flying-, and Rock-type attacks, though it is resistant to Fighting-type attacks. It does have two very useful moves in Spore and Knock Off, but unfortunately for Paras, Foongus exists and has a much better typing, better bulk, and a neutrality to Stealth Rock.", "Liepard": "Liepard is extremely versatile and unpredictable thanks to its plethora of viable sets such as Choice Band, Nasty Plot, and weather support. As a result of these sets' offensive nature, Liepard fits mostly on offensively based teams that appreciate its good Speed Tier and prowess. Liepard has access to Prankster, as well as useful offensive tools such as Pursuit, Sucker Punch, and Knock Off, allowing it to cripple teams. Despite these positives, Liepard has a notable flaw in the fact that its low Attack stat is low even when supplemented so it, struggles to break past bulky foes such as Weezing. Additionally, Liepard has mediocre bulk and is weak to common Fighting- and Fairy-type attacks. Without the proper coverage, it can struggle to retaliate against foes that use these moves. Lastly, Liepard is a prediction-reliant Pokemon, and being Choice-locked into Sucker Punch can be costly because it can give the opponent free turns to set up.", "Pidove": "Pidove's base stats are awful; it has terrible speed and offensive stats, along with lower bulk than other Flying-type Pokemon such as Doduo and Vullaby. This, combined with a lack of strong Flying-type moves, makes this Pokemon nearly unusable in Little Cup. The only niche that Pidove provides is in Z-Tailwind, which allows it to guarantee critical hits with its ability, Super Luck. Despite the team support and potential power Z-Tailwind provides, Pidove's low bulk and weak attacks put a cap on the amount of damage Pidove can really inflict.", "Sandslash": "Sandslash is a spinner that is outclassed by many other Pokemon within the PU tier. Alolan Sandslash has a useful Ice / Steel typing, and Slush Rush lets it fit well with Aurorus, while Hitmonchan has access to priority and greater moveset flexibility. Sandslash is also outclassed by Silvally-Fairy, Silvally-Dragon, Silvally-Water, and Silvally-Ghost, which have the added bonus of Parting Shot, and Skuntank, which can hit Ghost-types super effectively and pursuit trap. Sandslash is also hindered by many of the tier's Ghost-types such as Froslass and Jellicent, which can burn it with Will-O-Wisp or hit it super effectively with Water- or Ice-type attacks, and it has no real way to remove these threats reliably.", "Kangaskhan": null, "Magmortar": "Magmortar is a fantastic wallbreaker often capable of single-handedly dismantling defensive teams thanks to its great coverage options, its high Special Attack stat, and Taunt. Although Magmortar usually takes advantage of Z-Crystals to lure in and KO Pokemon like Audino and Vaporeon, it can choose to utilize Choice Specs to 2HKO virtually every one of its switch-ins. Magmortar also possesses decent special bulk, which lets it act as a soft check to threatening special attackers like Sceptile, Comfey, and Whimsicott. Unfortunately, Magmortar's poor physical bulk and weakness to entry hazards limit its ability to switch in repeatedly and leave it easily revenge killed by faster attackers like Aerodactyl, Choice Scarf Passimian, and Mega Glalie. Additionally, although Magmortar's Speed is fine for matchups against defensive teams, it gives Magmortar a lacking matchup against offensive ones, giving it fewer opportunities to safely wallbreak.", "Aron": "Thanks to Rock Head, Aron has access to a recoil-free 150-Base Power STAB move in Head Smash, which hits hard thanks to Aron's solid base 70 Attack. A great base 100 Defense allows Aron to survive strong physical hits, especially when coupled with an Eviolite. Its Steel / Rock typing gives it useful resistances, most notably to Fairy- and Flying-type attacks. However, its typing also gives it very common weaknesses to Water, Ground, and Fighting. Head Smash also has very low PP. It's difficult for Aron to set up on many things due to coverage moves such as Earthquake from Snubbull and Jump Kick from Doduo. Aron also has low Special Defense, meaning it can have a tough time switching in on special attacks. It faces competition from other setup sweepers that can be stronger and faster than a set-up Aron; Shell Smash users like Tirtouga and Shellder are particularly good examples. Aron also has very low Speed prior to a Rock Polish, meaning it can be KOed easily if it hasn't set up.", "Machamp": "Machamp's niche over other Fighting-types in the RU tier is its ability Guts, which can transform it into a powerful wallbreaker with Flame Orb, boasting over 590 Attack, while maintaining the flexibility to switch its moves and not worry about Toxic. Machamp's STAB move usefully threatens many of the tier's Stealth Rock setters, including Registeel, Rhyperior, and Gigalith, and the rest of its movepool allows it to either OHKO or 2HKO the remainder of the metagame. Even stall teams have little in the way of checks for Machamp, as Close Combat, Knock Off, and Facade can break through everything in conjunction with Machamp's Guts-boosted power and ability to switch moves. However, Machamp competes for a spot with Bewear and Pangoro, the tier's other premier Fighting-types, which both have access to Swords Dance along with better physical bulk in the former's case and a stronger Knock Off for the latter. In addition, without defensive investment, Machamp is fairly easy to revenge kill due to its poor Speed tier and lack of a STAB priority move, and it is worn down quickly thanks to residual damage stacking up from Flame Orb and pivoting into entry hazards.", "Tympole": "Tympole may have nice coverage moves, but its horrid stats make it only somewhat usable in rain, which can only be set with Rain Dance. Even as a rain sweeper, it finds itself outclassed by Mantyke, whose better stats give it more opportunities to set Rain Dance and whose better coverage moves and power make it more threatening than Tympole. Rain Dance is also difficult to use, as Tympole has to find a turn to set up with its poor bulk, only to gain four turns of rain after. This makes other offensive Water-types that don't rely on Rain Dance like Staryu much more favorable to a team; Staryu can also provide utility by clearing entry hazards.", "Grotle": null, "Omanyte": "Omanyte has a rock-solid place in the LC metagame thanks to its high Defense, which gives it many setup opportunities, coupled with its high Special Attack, which allows it to pressure the opponent's team at the same time. Omanyte is able to perform two very different roles, each with different counterplay, which gives it a certain measure of unpredictability. First, it can run a Shell Smash set, allowing it to boost its already-high Special Attack and sweep teams in the late-game. Alternatively, it can adopt a supporting role, using Weak Armor to boost its Speed and its wide support movepool to set entry hazards and disrupt the opposing team. In addition, Omanyte's typing gives it key resistances to Flying- and Fire-type moves, but it also gives it weaknesses to the more common Electric-, Grass-, and Fighting-type moves. Omanyte is also held back by its poor Speed, which leaves it reliant on either a Weak Armor or Shell Smash boost to perform its role effectively, and its lack of priority, leaving it susceptible to certain revenge killers.", "Slowpoke": "One of the most common tanks in the metagame, Slowpoke has great Defense and HP stats that allow it to tank most physical moves in conjunction with a reliable recovery option in Slack Off and a great defensive ability in Regenerator. Alongside its defensive stats, Slowpoke also has access to a great defensive moveset with utility moves such as Thunder Wave and good attacking options such as Scald, and moderate Attack and Special Attack stats that allow it to hit decently hard. Slowpoke's defensive typing is also beneficial, giving it resistances to many common attacks. Slowpoke's great physical Defense makes it a consistent and solid check to Mudbray, as it can easily take Mudbray's moves and KO it with Scald. Slowpoke is also welcome on most defensive cores due to its ability to freely switch out when it pleases due to the healing provided by Regenerator. Unfortunately, Slowpoke is rather passive and is often used as setup bait for Pokemon it can't touch, such as Scraggy, and it also serves as a free switch in for Pokemon such as Snivy. The common move Knock Off is a big threat to Slowpoke due to its high dependency on its Eviolite. Common pivoting moves like Volt Switch and U-turn are also threatening towards Slowpoke because they both deal super effective damage and provide momentum for the opposing team, which can be detrimental late-game.", "Abomasnow": "Mega Abomasnow's great Attack and Special Attack stats and powerful STAB attacks in Blizzard and Wood Hammer alongside coverage moves like Focus Blast and Earthquake make it an effective wallbreaker. Mega Abomasnow also enjoys switching into common walls in the tier like certain variants of Xatu, Vaporeon, and Seismitoad. Soundproof prior to Mega Evolution also helps the matchup against the likes of Heliolisk and Vikavolt by giving an immunity to what would otherwise be highly damaging STAB moves. However, a poor Speed stat and a vulnerability to entry hazard damage make it rather easy to wear down and revenge kill. Even Xatu and the Water-types it can supposedly switch into threaten it in one way or another, be it Toxic from Xatu or Vaporeon or Fire-type coverage from Slowking. Lastly, it faces competition with other breakers like Alolan Exeggutor and Mega Glalie that are overall faster and more powerful.", "Gligar": "Gligar possesses a unique mix of utility and defensive uses that gives it a solid niche in the UU metagame. Its respectable bulk when holding an Eviolite fits well with its wide array of support moves such as Stealth Rock, Defog, U-turn, and Knock Off. Its Ground / Flying typing also leaves it with only two weaknesses, notably providing a resistance to U-turn and immunity to Volt Switch, stopping users like Mega Manectric in their tracks. Additionally, it is one of the best answers to the some of the tier's hard-hitting Fighting-types like Cobalion, Choice-item Infernape, and Choice Band Terrakion. However, Gligar must invest significantly into Defense to handle the aforementioned physical threats, leaving it vulnerable to special wallbreakers like Moltres and Hydreigon, given its lackluster Special Defense stat. Gligar also finds itself more passive than it would prefer, offering opportunities for setup sweepers to start accumulating boosts and muscle past it. Lastly, Gligar's heavy reliance on its Eviolite to maintain its defensive capabilities makes it vulnerable to Knock Off from Pokemon like Krookodile, Scizor, and Zeraora.", "Exeggutor": "Exeggutor's niche in the PU tier is being a sun sweeper with access to Chlorophyll, doubling its Speed in sun. It also has a massive base 125 Special Attack stat with a 120-Base Power STAB Solar Beam and coverage in Psyshock to hit specially defensive Pokemon like Hitmonchan and Eelektross. Exeggutor has decent physical bulk, which lets it switch into resisted moves like Close Combat from Primeape and Zing Zap from Togedemaru, and it also resists priority moves like Mach Punch and Aqua Jet from Gurdurr, Hitmonchan, and Carracosta. Unfortunately, Exeggutor is weak to the prevalent Sucker Punch from Pokemon like Skuntank, Absol, and Spiritomb and has to rely on Sleep Powder to get around users of the move. Exeggutor has low special bulk, so it takes heavy damage from strong special attacks like Chatot's Boomburst. Exeggutor also has a low base Speed of 55, so even under sun, Exeggutor is still outsped by Choice Scarf users such as Primeape and Togedemaru. Exeggutor also possesses a crippling 4x weakness to Bug, leaving it rather vulnerable to U-turn from Pokemon like Mesprit and the previously mentioned Choice Scarf users. Outside of sun, Exeggutor is effectively unable to use one of its STAB moves, Solar Beam, leaving it more vulnerable to Pokemon such as Golurk and Mesprit. Finally, Exeggutor faces strong competition from other sun sweepers such as Victreebel, Sawsbuck, and Leafeon and competes with them for a teamslot on sun teams.", "Barboach": "Barboach's access to Dragon Dance makes it seem appealing; however, its poor base stats give it a hard time setting up and dealing damage. It faces trouble dealing with common Grass- and bulky Fighting-types after burning a Supersonic Skystrike, as that is Barboach's only significant method of damage to these Pokemon. As a setup sweeper, it is directly outclassed by Shellder and Corphish, as their better stats, damage output and movepool make them more ideal sweepers.", "Parasect": "Parasect's access to the rare Spore and a solid ability in Dry Skin cannot make up for the several crippling flaws it has in the PU metagame. It is absurdly slow, has lackluster bulk, and has an awful defensive typing; it is notably 4x weak to Flying and weak to Rock-, Ice-, and Poison-type attacks as well, which are all common in the PU metagame. Most of what Parasect can attempt to do, other Grass-types can do a lot better. Tangela has access to Regenerator and better bulk via Eviolite, Roselia has access to entry hazards and a solid secondary typing in addition to Eviolite, and Gourgeist-XL also has a better typing and access to moves like Will-O-Wisp. In general, these Grass-types also lack the aforementioned problems that come with Parasect's Bug typing.", "Grovyle": null, "Minun": "Minun is hopelessly outclassed by Electric-types such as Alolan Raichu, Rotom-F, and Eelektross, as their superior offensive stats and the former two's secondary typings make them more practical choices. Minun's lackluster stats bar its Speed mean it poses very little of a threat even after boosts and is easy to threaten in return.", "Budew": "Budew is the only Pokemon in LC with access to both Spikes and Sleep Powder, making it an excellent lead. Furthermore, Budew's decent defensive typing, usable bulk, and good ability in Natural Cure allow it to beat common Rapid Spin users such as Staryu and Kabuto as well as check common threats such as Mienfoo and Chinchou. However, Budew's low offensive stats make it relatively passive against Pokemon it can't hit for super effective damage, which can leave it as setup bait for common threats such as Vullaby. Furthermore, Budew suffers from slight four-moveslot syndrome, meaning it struggles to do everything it wants to do. Finally, Budew is usually outclassed by Ferroseed as a Grass-type Spikes user because of the latter's superior bulk and typing.", "Ditto": null, "Grubbin": null, "Eelektross": "Thanks to its good bulk and high power, Eelektross can become a solid pivot with Assault Vest. In particular, it makes for a very strong check to Ludicolo and Hidden Power variants of Lilligant. Eelektross's Levitate ability also essentially leaves it with no weaknesses outside of Mold Breaker Earthquake and lets it check, if not outright counter Ground-types such as Golurk and Mudsdale. A fantastic movepool including Giga Drain and Flamethrower gives Eelektross reliable options against Regirock and Alolan Dugtrio, and it possesses utility options like Knock Off to support the team. Finally, a strong and slow STAB Volt Switch helps Eelektross be a great pivot. However, Eelektross is worn down far quicker than you think due to a lack of reliable recovery and vulnerability to Toxic. Also, it faces competition as an Electric-type pivot with Lanturn, which has Scald, is notably faster than Pokemon like Modest Aurorus and Adamant Aggron, has access to moves like Heal Bell, a resistance to Fire-type attacks, and an immunity to Electric-type moves, though Lanturn lacks an immunity to Spikes and Toxic Spikes and doesn't have the same offensive presence that Eelektross does, which is a point in its favor.", "Sandygast": "Sandygast is a powerful special attacker with great physical bulk, allowing it to become an adequate sweeper under the right circumstances. These great stats combined with its offensive typing, which allows it to both spinblock and intercept Volt Switch while also giving it good neutral coverage, give it a significant niche. It also has a nice array of coverage moves. Sandygast is pretty sluggish even though it has Rock Polish to make up for its low Speed. One of Sandygast's major flaws is its low Special Defense which makes it weak to special attackers. Sandygast also lacks access to a useful ability, as it can only choose between Water Compaction and Sand Veil, both of which are mediocre abilities. Sandygast is outclassed by other Ground-type Pokemon such as Diglett and Mudbray in an offensive role because their good abilities and coverage give them more offensive presence; however, Sandygast is one of the strongest Ground-type special attackers. Sandygast may have a good offensive typing, but it is held back by its weakness to the commonly seen Knock Off and its low speed.", "Mudkip": "Mudkip struggles to justify itself a spot on competitive teams, due to a poor Speed tier and limited movepool. Although it possesses above-average stats all-around, Corphish and Carvanha are better Water-type attackers that bring additional coverage along with more potent offenses. Chinchou's Electric typing along with Staryu's access to reliable recovery make them better defensive options than Mudkip.", "Mantyke": "Mantyke's access to Rain Dance and Swift Swim as well as an excellent offensive typing allow it to function as a fairly effective late-game cleaner, especially since there are only two Pokemon in Little Cup that resist both of Mantyke's STAB moves\u2014Chinchou and the very uncommon Helioptile. It also has a gargantuan base 120 Special Defense stat, allowing it to set up on certain special attackers like Gastly, unboosted Snivy, and Croagunk. In addition, Mantyke resists common forms of priority in Aqua Jet, Mach Punch, and Vacuum Wave, which would otherwise be able to end its sweep prematurely. However, though Mantyke's Hydro Pump is very powerful when rain-boosted, its Air Slash is quite weak, especially coming off a low base 60 Special Attack stat. In addition, Mantyke's 4x weakness to Electric means it can sometimes get KOed by coverage moves on a Pokemon it can usually set up on, like Thunderbolt Gastly or Wild Charge Ponyta. A weakness to Stealth Rock means that Mantyke struggles to switch in repeatedly. Its pitiful physical bulk only amplifies this, as it can rarely switch into or set up on any physical attacker. Mantyke struggles greatly if rain is not up, as it is quite slow without a Swift Swim boost and Hydro Pump is weak without the boost from rain. In addition, since rain only lasts 4 turns, Mantyke is very limited in the time it has to sweep. Lastly, Mantyke faces a lot of competition from other offensive Water-types such as Shellder, Carvanha, and Omanyte, though its incredible STAB coverage and great Special Defense give it a niche.", "Diancie": "Mega Diancie's strong offensive capabilities and above average Speed stat make it a solid pick in the OU metagame. Its Rock / Fairy typing along with good coverage options in Earth Power make it difficult to switch into reliably, allowing it to dismantle certain defensive cores. Mega Diancie's Magic Bounce ability allows it to pressure common entry hazard setters such as Heatran and Clefable, as well as giving it an immunity to status moves. Mega Diancie is also able to reliably get up Stealth Rock against stall teams, as it is able to threaten Mega Sableye and common Defoggers such as Zapdos. Unfortunately, Mega Diancie's defensive stats are quite lackluster, leaving it very vulnerable to being revenge killed by common Choice Scarf users as well as faster Pokemon such as Greninja, Tapu Koko, and Mega Alakazam. This is made worse by Mega Diancie's common weaknesses to Ground-, Water-, Grass-, and Steel-type attacks. It also suffers to break past certain Pokemon commonly found on balance such as Celesteela, Magearna, and Tangrowth.", "Mesprit": "Mesprit is the most versatile Pokemon in PU, with a wide movepool that gives it several viable sets such as Choice Specs and defensive Stealth Rock and a great stat distribution that gives it both bulk and power. Mesprit notably has access to one of the best moves in the game in Stealth Rock, and it is undeniably the best setter in the tier thanks to great defensive stats and Levitate, which allow it to set with relative ease. It also has a fantastic matchup versus the best Rapid Spin user in the tier, Hitmonchan. Levitate also gives Mesprit immunity to all entry hazards except for Stealth Rock, preventing it from being worn down over repeated switches. Mesprit has access to a myriad of useful support moves such as Healing Wish, Thunder Wave, U-turn, and Trick, all allowing it to fulfill support roles. Healing Wish is one of the most notable ones, letting a weakened Mesprit sacrifice itself to fully restore the HP of a teammate. Mesprit also boasts a great offensive presence thanks to a solid base 105 Special Attack stat along with several offensive sets like Choice Specs, Choice Scarf, and (Substitute +) Calm Mind, which are capable of either wallbreaking or setting up on weaker, more passive Pokemon. The Choice sets offer either an immediately powerful special attacker or a decent revenge killer, while the Calm Mind sets offer a reliable sweeper. A Psychic typing along with Levitate allows Mesprit to check common Fighting-, Ground-, and Poison-types effectively, but it also leaves it vulnerable to Pursuit users such as Spiritomb and Skuntank, with more offensive sets being more prone to Sucker Punch users like Absol and the aforementioned Skuntank. Depending on the item Mesprit is holding, however, it is able to potentially beat these checks. Even though Mesprit has good stat distribution, its Speed is rather lacking, meaning that against more offensively based teams it can struggle, especially if it's running an offensive set. Bulkier sets also have no way of restoring HP outside of Leftovers, meaning they can be worn down throughout the course of the game.", "Bisharp": "Bisharp is one of UU's most capable sweepers and wallbreakers thanks to its solid offensive typing, access to Swords Dance, and excellent Attack stat. Its access to a powerful STAB Sucker Punch allows it to pick off weakened threats while deterring foes' attempts to revenge kill it, limiting some of its offensive counterplay. Bisharp can also muscle through large portions of the defensive metagame thanks to its powerful STAB moves in Knock Off and Iron Head, as well as its ability to use Black Hole Eclipse to take on some of its would-be defensive checks like Hippowdon and Gligar. Furthermore, its ability Defiant allows it to discourage the use of Defog from common entry hazard removers such as Hydreigon and Empoleon. With its unique set of resistances, Bisharp can also pull off an Assault Vest set capable of tanking hits from and Pursuit trapping prominent special attackers like Latias, Celebi, and Nihilego. However, Bisharp's offensive prowess is slightly held back by its defensive drawbacks, such as its middling overall bulk, which prevents it from checking foes like Hydreigon, Latias, and Togekiss as reliably as it'd like to if not running Assault Vest. This is further compounded by the disadvantages of its typing, which include a huge weakness to the tier's several Fighting-types, like Infernape and Cobalion, and weaknesses to other common types in Fire and Ground. Because of its poor Speed, Bisharp can also tend to overrely on Sucker Punch, which, due to the attack's poor reliability, requires that Bisharp predicts carefully when using it so as not to allow foes like Gengar and Moltres to take advantage of it by using Substitute or restoring health, respectively.", "Zangoose": "Zangoose is a very powerful Normal-type wallbreaker. STAB Facade along with its other attacks hits extremely hard when combined with Toxic Orb and Toxic Boost. Zangoose also boasts excellent coverage options in Knock Off and Close Combat that allow it to hit Ghost-, Rock-, and Steel-types. Its middling Speed stat is somewhat nullified by Zangoose's access to Quick Attack, which lets it hit faster threats and take out weakened foes. This is especially useful for Zangoose's Belly Drum set, which can be a deadly sweeper. However, although it has great offensive capability, Zangoose is hindered a lot by its subpar defensive stats and Toxic damage, which ultimately means it can be easily revenge killed. Zangoose also faces competition from other Normal-types in the tier such as Kangaskhan and Stoutland, which, although not hitting as hard, can usually be more reliable, as they don't have Toxic damage wearing them down each turn.", "Kyurem": "Kyurem is an interesting pick in the OU metagame thanks to its ability to PP stall several Pokemon with its useful combination of Substitute, Pressure, and Roost. Kyurem's typing and respectable bulk allow it to take advantage of some of OU's premier walls, such as Toxapex and Tangrowth, and pivot into Choice-locked Kartana's Leaf Blade and Greninja's Hydro Pump. Its high base Special Attack and access to Ice- and Ground-type coverage let it hit a vast majority of the OU tier for neutral damage and threaten many common Pokemon like Landorus-T, Heatran, and Tornadus-T. However, Kyurem's mediocre base 95 Speed leaves more to be wished for in a metagame full of faster threats that can beat it, such as Mega Alakazam, Mega Medicham, and Kartana. Kyurem is also susceptible to every form of entry hazard and requires entry hazard control to perform its niche to its fullest potential. Moreover, Kyurem's ability to PP stall takes a big hit if it is inflicted with status, which is fairly common in the OU metagame, and its typing leaves it susceptible to the plethora of Steel-, Fairy-, and Fighting-type Pokemon and moves that plague the tier.", "Sigilyph": "Sigilyph has access to Magic Guard, one of the best abilities in the game, which gives it immunity to all passive damage, including Stealth Rock damage, Toxic damage, and Life Orb recoil. Good Speed, good enough Special Attack, and an incredibly wide offensive movepool let Sigilyph act as a potent wallbreaker that can still pose a threat to offense thanks to its Speed. A wide support movepool lets Sigilyph sustain itself using Roost, act as a late-game sweeper using Calm Mind, and generally support its team with utility options such as Thunder Wave and Defog. However, Sigilyph is stuck with fairly low bulk, leaving it easily Pursuit trapped by Sneasel and vulnerable to being revenged killed by attacks such as Passimian's Knock Off. This low bulk and its susceptibility to coverage moves also heavily limit its opportunities to switch in, as Sigilyph takes significant damage even from neutral attacks, being easily 2HKOed by Steelix's Heavy Slam. While Sigilyph's Special Attack is good enough for it to deal heavy damage on super effective hits and against frail Pokemon, it struggles against dedicated special walls.", "Psyduck": "Too slow and sporting abysmal defenses, Psyduck has very little use in Little Cup. Base 55 Speed means that even with a Choice Scarf, Psyduck is not fast enough to outspeed threats such as Choice Scarf Snivy. Outclassed by Staryu in utility, Speed, and raw power and limited to two niche and near useless abilities in Cloud Nine and Swift Swim, Psyduck makes for an unviable Little Cup Pokemon.", "Florges": "Florges possesses good special bulk as well as a Fairy typing, which allows it to be an effective check to the likes of Mandibuzz, Mega Blastoise, Bewear, and Yanmega. In addition, it also bears a good support movepool with tools such as Heal Bell and Defog that give it good ways to support its team, and it possesses decent offensive presence with Moonblast. However, the ubiquity of Poison- and Steel-types in RU makes Florges extremely vulnerable to being forced out or becoming setup fodder for the likes of Salazzle, Nidoqueen, and Metagross. Its middling physical bulk also makes it fairly easy to pressure with neutral attacks, particularly from stronger threats such as Feraligatr. Overall, while Florges can be an effective utility Pokemon, you should be careful to deal with its vulnerability to several common threats in the tier so that it doesn't become a liability.", "Nidoqueen": "Nidoqueen is an excellent offensive Stealth Rock setter and wallbreaker thanks to its strong Life Orb- and Sheer Force-boosted attacks and its access to Taunt and Toxic. Its effectiveness as a Stealth Rock setter is bolstered by the fact that it beats almost every entry hazard remover in the tier thanks to its impeccable coverage. Nidoqueen's typing gives it an immunity to Electric and useful resistances that allow it to check common Pokemon. However, Nidoqueen's average Speed tier prevents it from outpacing common Pokemon such as Necrozma, Feraligatr, and Roserade. Nidoqueen also struggles to beat walls like Milotic, Cresselia, and Umbreon unless running Toxic or niche coverage moves. For example, it can run Thunderbolt for Milotic or Focus Blast for Umbreon. However, Nidoqueen can still struggle to break through Pokemon even when running the appropriate coverage attack; one case of this is relying on the inaccurate Focus Blast to break through Pokemon like Snorlax and the aforementioned Umbreon.", "Altaria": "Altaria's Mega Evolution gifts it with several notable improvements, ranging from stat boosts to a strong typing in Dragon / Fairy and a fantastic ability in Pixilate. Its well-rounded stats and access to a plethora of utility options like Dragon Dance, Heal Bell, Defog, and Fire Blast among others make Mega Altaria an incredibly versatile Pokemon that can run a variety of sets viably and fit on all playstyles. Due to its fantastic defensive typing, Mega Altaria offers teams a strong answer to threats like Hydreigon, Kommo-o, and Crawdaunt, often no matter what set it opts to use itself. However, Mega Evolving in a timely manner is crucial for Altaria to fulfill these defensive responsibilities. Additionally, while its stats are well-distributed, Mega Altaria is ultimately held back by its unspectacular attacking and Speed stats. Its initial lack of formidable damage output leads to struggles against bulky foes such as Sylveon, defensive Primarina, and Mega Aggron, while its mediocre Speed leaves it easily revenge killed by threats like Nidoking, Nihilego, and Cobalion. Also, while Altaria loses its Stealth Rock weakness upon Mega Evolution, it becomes susceptible to all other entry hazards. This combines with its lack of passive recovery to make Mega Altaria easily worn down, often leading to a constant need to sacrifice momentum by using Roost.", "Jellicent": "Jellicent is an exceptional wallbreaker thanks to not only Water Spout but also a virtually unresisted STAB combination plus options like Trick to further cripple defensive Pokemon. Its support movepool, bulk, recovery, and typing let it also perform as a self-sufficient defensive spinblocker with great anti-stall utility, checking threats like Scyther, Crabominable, and Combusken while spinblocking effectively against Himtonchan and non-Toxic Alolan Sandslash. Water Absorb enhances its defensive capabilities, letting it pivot into Omastar and opposing Jellicent while checking offensive Qwilfish more reliably. Unfortunately, offensive threats to Jellicent are prevalent due to its typing weaknesses to common attackers like Lilligant, Skuntank, and Togedemaru. Pursuit trappers are also a major form of counterplay to wallbreaker sets. Toxic and entry hazards hinder its breaking potential and survivability despite its recovery, although Taunt can shut down many slower users of these moves. Nevertheless, Jellicent has a major teambuilding impact and is easily one of the best Pokemon in PU.", "Chandelure": "Chandelure's massive Special Attack stat along with a great STAB combination in Fire and Ghost makes it a notable threat in the UU metagame. Its typing also allows it to be an offensive check to the likes of Cobalion, non-Knock Off Scizor, and non-Stone Edge Infernape. Furthermore, an immunity to Seismic Toss from Blissey and the ability to cripple bulky walls with Trick or avoid status with Substitute also defines its role as a stallbreaker, allowing it to take advantage of numerous bulky Pokemon in the tier; in general, it matches up outstandingly against bulkier teams, carving through them without much effort. Unfortunately, its poor bulk and lackluster Speed tier mean that even Choice Scarf variants are outsped and KOed by most of the tier's Choice Scarf users, such as Krookodile, Hydreigon, and Terrakion, and by very fast Mega Evolutions such as Mega Beedrill, Mega Sceptile, and Mega Aerodactyl. Non-Choice Scarf variants have to worry even more about being outrun, as even the likes of Heracross, Nidoking, and Entei are faster. Additionally, a vulnerability to all entry hazards, but most notably Stealth Rock, compromises Chandelure's ability to pivot into the few Pokemon it checks and gives it fewer opportunities to wallbreak.", "Deoxys": null, "Meloetta": "Unfortunately, Meloetta simply has no place in the UU metagame. Despite its great Special Attack and natural bulk, its mediocre typing leaves with only two resistances and a common weakness in Dark, it lacks recovery, and it has an average Speed tier that puts it behind most Choice Scarf users even with a boost. For these reasons, it is hopelessly outclassed by Latias as an offensive Psychic-type. The closest it has to a worthwhile niche is as a late-game sweeper with Z-Celebrate, which, even with its bulk and power, is easy to both wall and overwhelm offensively due to its aforementioned setbacks.", "Togekiss": "Togekiss finds itself a comfortable place among UU's top threats, as it has solidified its role as one of the premier stallbreakers in the tier. Togekiss's Fairy / Flying typing comes with useful tools such as an immunity to Ground, a resistance to Pursuit, and the ability to stop many common threats such as Hydreigon, Krookodile, and Kommo-o. Despite being primarily known for its ability to easily power through many defensive cores, Togekiss can bring a wide array of supportive options such as Heal Bell, Defog, and Thunder Wave to a team. Togekiss's ability Serene Grace boosts its Air Slash flinch rate to a whopping 60 percent, meaning just about any Pokemon slower than it is at risk of being broken through, leaving very little true defensive counterplay to Togekiss. In addition to Air Slash, Togekiss possesses powerful coverage moves such as Fire Blast, Dazzling Gleam, and Aura Sphere. Backed by its high base 120 Special Attack, it can bypass many of its conventional checks with the appropriate move. While Togekiss may seem extremely powerful, it has many weaknesses to common Pokemon that hold it back greatly; it is vulnerable to many top threats in the tier such as Mega Aerodactyl, Mega Beedrill, Mega Manectric, Scizor, Nidoking, and Cobalion. In addition, Togekiss only boasts a middling base 80 Speed, meaning many of UU's best sweepers and cleaners can easily outpace it. Togekiss also finds it difficult to make itself a quickly threatening offensive presence due to its lack of immediate power or high-powered STAB moves. Combined with a troublesome weakness to common sights such as Stealth Rock, Volt Switch, and Scizor's Bullet Punch, Togekiss is far from impossible to take down.", "Luxio": null, "Oranguru": "While Oranguru's vast movepool, decent Special Attack, and bulk are appealing, it struggles to find its place in the tier. Its mediocre typing leaves it susceptible to Dark-types such as Skuntank and unable to reliably check Fighting-types like Hitmonchan. Its Special Attack, while decent, leaves it unable to do much prior setup, and its ability is rather situational. As an offensive Psychic-type Trick Room setter, it is outclassed by Beheeyem, which sports a better ability and Special Attack.", "Venusaur": "Mega Venusaur's very good bulk allows it to check a plethora of prominent threats in the OU metagame, including Magearna, Kartana, Tapu Koko, Serperior, Battle Bond Greninja pre-transformation, and Tapu Bulu. Its Thick Fat ability and decent defensive typing leave it with only two weaknesses, Psychic and Flying, while giving it resistances to many common types, such as Water and Fairy. Mega Venusaur is surprisingly not very passive, as it possesses a solid Special Attack stat of base 122. However, Mega Venusaur faces competition from Tangrowth and Toxapex, both of which perform similar roles and don't need to rely as much on recovery because they have Regenerator. Mega Venusaur is easily worn down by entry hazards, Scald burns, and even just powerful attacks, so it finds itself using Synthesis a lot as opposed to attacking, which results in momentum loss and passivity. Lastly, Synthesis only has 8 PP, which often forces Mega Venusaur to heal itself more sparingly to compensate.", "Tepig": "Tepig may have access to powerful STAB moves, useful coverage, and a decent ability in Thick Fat, but the rest of its movepool, in terms of utility, is shallow, its stats are mediocre, and its single Fire typing isn't really great offensively or defensively. Specifically, some main problems Tepig has include being too slow to be a good offensive Pokemon and running mostly moves that cause recoil damage, which hinders its longevity. These disadvantages leave it heavily outclassed by superior Fire-types such as Ponyta and Magby because of their better offensive stats.", "Blastoise": "Mega Blastoise is RU's best spinner by far, giving it an important place on many offensive and balanced teams. Its high Special Attack and excellent Mega Launcher-boosted coverage make it a pain for offensive teams to switch into, and between the switches its prowess forces and the passive walls that teams often use to check it, it finds many opportunities to spin. Having Dark Pulse to keep Ghost-types from safely spinblocking and outspeeding common coverage-weak Stealth Rock setters in Bronzong, Nidoqueen, and Rhyperior make its job even easier. Its good natural bulk enables it to take at least one strong neutral hit to deal massive damage back or do one last spin. Mega Blastoise's greatest flaw is its complete lack of recovery; this issue combined with its susceptibility to all forms of entry hazards and status leads to it inevitably getting worn down. Its average Speed tier renders it easy to offensively pressure, especially since switching in to spin several times will put it in KO range of many faster attackers. Milotic, one of the most common walls in the metagame, always beats it outside of unlucky Dark Pulse flinches, while facing competition from it as a Water-type, as Milotic has recovery to consistently check many foes.", "Latios": "Mega Latios's great Speed tier and offensive stats make it a premier check to several threats in the OU metagame such as Heatran, Landorus-T, and Gliscor. Moreover, its excellent offensive typing, high-powered STAB attacks, and vast range of coverage options make Mega Latios a formidable offensive threat in its own right, able to threaten defensive staples like Toxapex, Gliscor, Mega Venusaur, and Zapdos. Mega Latios also sports numerous type resistances, great bulk, and access to recovery, enabling it to act as a solid pivot into Water-, Grass-, Electric-, and Fire-type attacks. Mega Latios' higher Attack allows it to 2HKO common switch-ins to Latios with Earthquake, such as Heatran, Assault Vest Magearna, and Tyranitar after Stealth Rock and Spikes damage. Base forme Latios is also a decent pick, mostly by the same reasons of its Mega forme, but it suffers stiff competition to stand out. Despite their strengths, though, both Latios formes are threatened by common Fairy-types in the tier such as Tapu Lele, Mega Mawile, and Magearna and walled by Steel-types like Celesteela, Heatran, and Ferrothorn should Mega Latios or its base forme lack the appropriate coverage. Both formes are also troubled by faster offensive threats such as Greninja, Tapu Koko, and Mega Alakazam and are highly vulnerable to Pursuit trappers like Weavile, and on regular Latios's case, Tyranitar.", "Cubchoo": "Cubchoo's ability Slush Rush along with its decent offensive stats allows it to be a potent hail sweeper. Cubchoo also has access to Water-type coverage to check Fire-types, which are generally quite threatening to hail teams. However, Cubchoo faces competition from Alolan Sandshrew, which has the same ability along with Rapid Spin and a secondary Steel typing. This leads to Cubchoo being a niche pick for hail teams at best. In addition, its weak STAB attack means it often underperforms despite its high Attack stat. Cubchoo's poor defensive typing and bad defensive stats also leave it weak to many common threats in LC, such as Ponyta and Mienfoo, as well as common priority moves like Timburr's Mach Punch. This bad bulk, coupled with a weakness to Stealth Rock, means it struggles to find opportunities to switch in. Finally, Cubchoo is absolutely useless outside of hail due to its poor Speed stat.", "Pachirisu": "Any viability Pachirisu could have with its decent utility movepool and Speed is utterly eclipsed by its horrendous defensive stats and lack of reliable recovery. Other Electric-types such as Lanturn and Oricorio-E offer far more useful utility courtesy of their higher stats, their dual typings, and the latter's access to recovery.", "Fearow": "Fearow has a multitude of issues in pitiful bulk, average offensive stats, a weakness to Stealth Rock, and a reliance on critical hits to shore up its low-powered attacks, which makes its damage output inconsistent. It is also hopelessly outclassed by the likes of Dodrio and Scyther due to their access to Swords Dance, better Speed tiers, and better bulk, the former having a much stronger Flying-type STAB move and the latter sporting U-turn as well. Fearow's access to Ground-type coverage and ability to take advantage of critical hits, especially inconsistently, are not enough to save it from being an awful choice in the metagame.", "Marill": null, "Piplup": "Piplup has a niche as one of the few LC Pokemon that can both set up hazards with Stealth Rock and get rid of the opponent's with Defog, giving it decent role compression. It's also a Defog user that isn't weak to Stealth Rock, allowing it to switch in more easily. Supporting this are its decent defenses and good defensive typing, letting it take resisted attacks and some neutral ones. Its access to a Water-type STAB move in Scald lets it beat most traditional Stealth Rock setters like Onix and Dwebble. However, Piplup is extremely passive, making it setup bait for sweepers like Shellder and Calm Mind Spritzee. It is also forced into performing its predictable niche, as it's outclassed as a Water-type attacker by Chinchou and defensive Staryu due to their better Speed and movepools. Piplup has access to no recovery outside of Rest, making it prone to getting worn down over time. Finally, it faces competition from Kabuto, a Water-type hazard setter with Rapid Spin, Knock Off, and Weak Armor, as well from Slowpoke and Mareanie, bulkier Water-types with access to Regenerator and recovery.", "Bulbasaur": "Bulbasaur is a potent sweeper in the LC metagame, as Z-Celebrate allows it to clean mid- or late-game and sweep unprepared teams with ease. Additionally, its Z-Celebrate-boosted bulk and access to Sleep Powder allow it to take some hits from strong Pokemon or immobilize them after setting up, since its good defensive typing gives it some key resistances, such as Fighting, Fairy, and Water. Unfortunately, Bulbasaur is frail and weak without the Z-Celebrate boosts, and it lacks setup opportunities against most of the Pokemon in the metagame since it is weak to common types such as Psychic and Flying. Bulbasaur also has a bad movepool and has to rely on Hidden Power Fire to do significant damage to Steel- and Poison-types, even with a Z-Celebrate boost, which can only be obtained once. Bulbasaur is also outsped by common Choice Scarf users such as Doduo and Rufflet. Bulbasaur also faces competition with Pumpkaboo-S, as both can use Z-Moves to boost all of their stats, and Z-Trick-or-Treat is obviously more useful than Z-Celebrate.", "Jigglypuff": null, "Cascoon": null, "Abra": "Abra has exceptionally high Speed and Special Attack stats as well as a very useful ability in Magic Guard, which gives it the potential to function as either the tier's best revenge killer with a Focus Sash or a menacing wallbreaker with Life Orb. However, for as good as Abra's offensive capabilities are, it has less bulk than wet tissue paper, not to mention it is also vulnerable to all forms of trapping in the tier.", "Ralts": "Despite Trace being a cool ability, Ralts is horribly frail and lacks offensive pressure, making it very difficult to justify use in the tier. As an offensive Psychic-type, it is wildly outlclassed by Abra, which is significantly faster and stronger than Ralts. As a Fairy-type, Spritzee is significantly better due to its sheer bulk and great team support. Ralts's only defining niche is that it is able to revenge trap Diglett by Tracing Arena Trap, but it is often ineffective at this because it fails to KO Diglett from full HP. Ralts also gets some useful support moves, but other than Destiny Bond and Memento, Ralts will often not get to make use of them because of how frail it is.", "Muk": "Muk carves a niche in the metagame as a capable bulky setup sweeper thanks to its access to Curse, managing to separate itself from other bulky setup sweepers like Spiritomb and Type: Null because of its inability to be crippled by Trick, Switcheroo, and Knock Off, courtesy of its ability Sticky Hold. Muk can also serve as a decent check to certain threatening special attackers such as Lilligant, Clefairy, Floatzel, and Pyroar due to its high special bulk, with its typing also allowing it to absorb Toxic Spikes. Because of its high Attack, powerful STAB Gunk Shot, access to Shadow Sneak to slightly mitigate its low Speed, and expansive coverage in moves such as Fire Punch, Ice Punch, and Explosion allowing it to threaten Pokemon like Mawile, Claydol, and Weezing, Muk is also capable of pulling off a Choice Band set, standing apart from Skuntank due to its higher Attack and Special Defense as well as its ability to more reliably switch into Clefairy. However, Muk still faces a decent amount of competition as both a setup sweeper and an offensive Poison-type. Curse Muk requires a lot more support to work than other bulky setup sweepers like Spiritomb, Type: Null, and Lurantis, while Skuntank tends to outperform Choice Band Muk due to its higher Speed, secondary Dark typing that allows it to threaten Ghost- and Psychic-types, and greater utility. Muk's typing isn't very good offensively, and it struggles to break through certain Steel-, Ground-, and Ghost-types like Aggron, Mudsdale, and Spiritomb because of this. Choice Band Muk is also relatively easy to exploit because of how common bulkier Pokemon like Qwilfish and Weezing are. Despite Shadow Sneak slightly mitigating Muk's low Speed, it will still often have to take a hit before dishing one out in response. Finally, Muk is vulnerable to strong physical attackers like Kingler and Zangoose because of its low Defense.", "Boldore": null, "Marshtomp": null, "Throh": "Throh's access to STAB Circle Throw makes it a very durable phazer; it is able to wear teams down due to its ability to take hits with its respectable bulk, and it will almost always force a Pokemon to be brought out against it. It is also able to hold its own against special attackers such as Pyroar and Combusken. These attributes let it serve as a bulky setup sweeper with Bulk Up, and it is because of this that Throh is able to hold a niche over other Fighting-types in the tier, such as Gurdurr and Hitmonchan, despite competing with them for a teamslot. Additionally, its ability Guts lets Throh act as a status absorber for its team, allowing it to switch into Scald and other status moves with near-impunity. However, Throh relies on entry hazard damage through phazing to deal most of its damage, meaning Ghost-types like Haunter and Oricorio-G effectively shut down sets that lack Knock Off. Throh has great bulk, but this is somewhat diminished by its subpar typing, bringing few notable resistances and making it weak to prominent Psychic-types such as Jynx, Mesprit, and Musharna. This, combined with Throh's lack of reliable recovery, means that it is prone to getting worn down easily over the course of a match and forces it to rely on RestTalk as a means of recovery.", "Wartortle": null, "Wigglytuff": "It may have a very large movepool that includes support options like Stealth Rock, a gigantic HP stat, and a unique typing in PU, but Wigglytuff constantly finds itself outclassed by other defensive Normal- and Fairy-types such as Audino, Clefairy, and Granbull thanks to their better stats overall. This relegates it to being an offensive Stealth Rock user that can pressure Defog users with decent neutral coverage. However, Wigglytuff's middling defenses and mediocre firepower make using it difficult. Wigglytuff also has to compete against other offensive Stealth Rock setters such as Aggron and Aurorus thanks to their better stats, typings, abilities, and ability to actually pressure Defoggers such as Skuntank.", "Pignite": null, "Deerling": "Deerling's ability Sap Sipper provides it with an important niche as an offensive check to Snivy. It is also blessed with a fantastic Speed tier, outspeeding the likes of Mienfoo, Onix, and most importantly Snivy, and with a unique STAB combination that is nicely complemented by Jump Kick. However, Deerling's defensive typing is horrible in Little Cup, leaving it with many weaknesses to common types, notably Fighting-, Flying-, and Poison-types. This is coupled with rather poor defensive stats, meaning it can be easily KOed by even neutral attacks. Finally, even with a Life Orb, Deerling's attacks aren't really very powerful, so common bulky Pokemon like Vullaby, Ferroseed, and Mienfoo can easily wall it.", "Magikarp": "The year is 2019. The Pokemon world, too, is suffering from the ravages of climate change. Decades of industrialization, oil spills, and poor environmental management have turned the seven seas into cesspools of toxicity. Oceanic food chains are collapsing as temperatures rise, boiling the sea. The ocean can no longer bear the legacy of human callousness. Yet still, something emerges out of the poisoned waters. A young boy casts his Old Rod, confident that he will succeed in his daily catch. A grizzled old man travels the waters in a rowboat, searching for a white Wailord. These are the people of the damaged sea, and they will never abandon it.", "Pawniard": "Pawniard is a metagame-defining force and a very potent wallbreaker with excellent STAB coverage and the strongest Knock Off in the tier. Its great offensive typing is really good defensively as well, taking on Flying- and Grass-type Pokemon with ease. It also severely threatens anything slower than it due to its good coverage, powerful attacks, and the potential for an Iron Head flinch. Additionally, unlike many of the best wallbreakers, Pawniard is no slouch against offense due to its powerful Sucker Punch. It does have a few flaws, though; a middling Speed stat leaves Pawniard in an awkward Speed tier, and it struggles with Fighting- and Fire-type Pokemon, which make for its best checks. Lastly, Pawniard suffers from having shaped the metagame in the past; more Pokemon run coverage moves for Pawniard than for any other Pokemon.", "Dusknoir": "Dusknoir is a niche spinblocker with its main attribute being its high defensive stats. This allows it to switch in and spinblock with less fear of being greatly weakened. However, this niche is limited with Dusknoir's poor HP stat and lack of a form of recovery. Its solid movepool is another thing Dusknoir has going for it, with great coverage and priority, but this is held back by Dusknoir's lack of a strong STAB option. This, alongside Dusknoir's only average Attack stat, makes it pretty passive even when holding a Choice Band. Golurk and Spiritomb both outclass Dusknoir because they possess secondary typings; offensively, Golurk has a powerful STAB Earthquake and Spiritomb has a strong STAB Sucker Punch and Pursuit, and defensively, their typing gives them more resistances and immunities.", "Skrelp": "Skrelp is a powerful wallbreaker in the LC metagame due to its good typing, which gives it excellent coverage with just its STAB moves, and Adaptability, which boosts the power of these STAB moves. With those traits coupled with a solid Special Attack stat, Skrelp becomes very difficult to switch into. Defensively, Skrelp has eight resistances, most notably to the common Fighting and Fairy types, which gives it the ability to switch in on common Pokemon and pressure them out with its offensive potential. However, Skrelp is held back offensively by poor Speed, a shallow movepool that leaves it reliant on Hidden Power to hit the Pokemon that otherwise wall it, and a lack of recovery outside of Rest. Defensively, Skrelp faces competition from Mareanie, which has the same typing and comparable defensive stats but can check the same Pokemon more reliably thanks to its ability Regenerator, which forces Skrelp into an offensive role. It is also held back by weaknesses to common Ground- and Electric-type attacks and to Diglett, which can revenge kill it with no possibility of Skrelp switching out.", "Baltoy": "Thanks to Baltoy's typing and Levitate, it resists Stealth Rock and is immune to other entry hazards, allowing it to remove said hazards fairly easily. However, Baltoy's defensive typing does it more harm than good, leaving it weak to several common attacking types as well as the omnipresent Knock Off. Its weak offensive stats and unhelpful Speed tier prevent it from posing as a serious threat, and it's outclassed by Drilbur and Kabuto as a hazard setter and remover.", "Pidgeotto": null, "Rattata": "Rattata's decent Speed tier and high Attack stat along with Hustle and several coverage options may make it sound like a good breaker which dismantles many teams on paper, but in practice it is quite frail and gets easily revenge killed by priority moves such as Mach Punch from Timburr and Sucker Punch from Pawniard. Its heavy reliance on Hustle makes Rattata an unoptimal breaker, as it depends on accuracy to land some important hits. As such, Rattata is outclassed by Rufflet as a Hustle wallbreaker due to Rufflet's higher Attack, better bulk, ability to set up, and better STAB attacks, and Bunnelby, which has Huge Power and better coverage options.", "Girafarig": "While Girafarig may sport a rare typing and an expansive movepool, its fairly average stats, vulnerability to Pursuit, and strict competition makes it an overall very mediocre choice. Other Psychic-types such as Mesprit, Alolan Raichu, and Jynx outclass any Girafarig sets aiming to set up with Calm Mind or Nasty Plot due to having greater bulk or superior Speed tiers. Stoutland and Dodrio are also tough competition as much stronger physical Normal-type wallbreakers, with Stoutland wielding Scrappy and Dodrio easily outrunning it, and neither are weak to Pursuit.", "Granbull": "Granbull is one of the rare Fairy-types in PU, albeit a mediocre one. However, its combination of a wide movepool, high Attack stat for a support Pokemon, solid physical bulk, and a great ability in Intimidate gives it some reason to use. Its Fairy typing allows it to both wall and take down common threats such as Hitmonchan and Gurdurr as well as the elusive Sableye and Spiritomb. One of Granbull's main selling points over other Fairy-types is its access to Earthquake, which discourages Poison- and Steel-types such as Aggron and Qwilfish from switching in. Granbull's access to utility moves such as Heal Bell and Thunder Wave also allows it to diminish potential threats for its team. Unfortunately, Granbull suffers from a low Special Defense stat, meaning Granbull can be used exclusively as a physical wall, as well as a poor base 45 Speed stat, leaving it weak to Taunt and affecting its ability to hit its threats first with an Earthquake. Its low Speed also furthers its susceptibility to special attacks. Granbull also lacks reliable recovery and relies on Leftovers or Z-Heal Bell to heal. Because of this, Granbull's role as a defensive Fairy-type is contested by Clefairy and Silvally-Fairy, with the former having better special bulk as well as access to Soft-Boiled and Stealth Rock and the latter having access to Parting Shot and Defog.", "Kabutops": "Kabutops is a solid Choice Scarf user that has plenty of utility in checking top threats such as Oricorio-G and Froslass due to its unique combination of typing and Speed. Unlike most Choice Scarf users, it functions more as a utility revenge killer, with excellent support options such as Rapid Spin and Knock Off, and not as a check to most setup sweepers due to its mediocre base Speed. Kabutops is also notable for its role on rain teams, as its solid Speed, decent Attack, access to Swords Dance, and excellent STAB combination all make it highly suited to become one of the tier's top rain sweepers. Kabutops gets by on key resistances to Fire, Flying, Ice, and Normal, but its typing is a double-edged sword, leaving it with common weaknesses to Fighting, Ground, Electric, and Grass. This leaves it vulnerable to many coverage moves such as Kangaskhan's Earthquake and Dodrio's Jump Kick, and this can often limit its opportunities for setup or revenge killing. Additionally, outside of rain, Kabutops is prone to being revenge killed by common Choice Scarf users such as Primeape and Togedemaru and struggles with how common Mach Punch Hitmonchan and Gurdurr are. Ultimately, Kabutops faces a lot of competition from faster Choice Scarf users such as Togedemaru, Primeape, and Swanna, which are far more capable at revenge killing, and only sets itself apart with its unique set of resistances and ability to remove entry hazards.", "Venipede": "Venipede's access to Speed Boost and Spikes gives it a niche as a reliable entry hazard setter that can deal with common spinners and hazard setters such as Staryu, Drilbur, and Onix using Bloom Doom. Additionally, its multi-hit STAB move Pin Missile can OHKO Focus Sash users like Abra and is generally powerful. Unlike other Spikes setters, Venipede can effectively set up Spikes at nearly any point in the game. Its defensive typing is also pretty good, granting it a 4x resistance to the incredibly common Fighting- and Grass-type moves. Sadly, Venipede's overall poor offensive presence and relatively poor defensive presence make it outclassed by other hazard setters if reliability isn't needed, mainly Ferroseed and Dwebble, which have much better defensive and offensive presence, respectively.", "Vulpix": null, "Sylveon": "Sylveon is one of the best clerics in the tier thanks to its mono-Fairy typing allowing it to switch into strong and powerful Dragon-, Dark-, and Fighting-type moves such as Latias and Hydreigon's Draco Meteor, Krookodile's Knock Off, and Infernape's Close Combat. It also has access to Wish and Heal Bell, which allows it to keep its teammates healthy throughout a match and get rid of potentially damaging status conditions. Additionally, it can take most unboosted special attacks due to its superb special bulk and can retaliate with a strong Pixilate-boosted Hyper Voice. However, some special attackers such as Volcanion and Primarina can 2HKO Sylveon in spite of its bulk. Latias in particular can beat Sylveon with a combination of Calm Mind and Roost. Sylveon is further held back by its mediocre base 65 Defense stat, which means it is 2HKOed by some physical attackers, such as Choice Band Infernape and Terrakion, even with maximum investment. Furthermore, it also has weaknesses to common Poison- and Steel-type moves from the likes of Scizor and Nidoking. It also faces competition from Florges, which trades a lower Defense stat and weaker attacks for more Speed and access to a one-turn recovery move.", "Haunter": "Haunter is an overall decent offensive threat, being able to serve as a wallbreaker with its Life Orb set or as a revenge killer with its Choice Scarf set. This is mostly thanks to its good base 95 Speed tier, which allows it to outspeed Pokemon such as Lilligant and Zangoose and Speed tie with Pokemon such as Jynx and Primeape. Base 115 Special Attack allows Haunter to even more reliably revenge kill such Pokemon or break through bulkier Pokemon such as Weezing and Tangela. Furthermore, Haunter\u2019s good Ghost / Poison typing allows it to hit almost the entire metagame neutrally with STAB attacks and combines with Levitate to give Haunter three useful immunities in Ground, Normal, and Fighting. Haunter also has a vast utility movepool that includes moves such as Destiny Bond, Trick, Will-O-Wisp, and Substitute, which allows it to better handle its checks and support its teammates. Despite this, Dark-types are always a large problem for Haunter, as Skuntank resists both of its STAB moves while Spiritomb can bypass Substitute, and both can Pursuit trap Haunter or threaten it with Sucker Punch, although they do fear certain utility or coverage moves. Haunter's abysmal defenses leave it unable to switch into even most resisted hits, and it can be easily revenge killed by faster threats and priority users assuming it does not have a Substitute up. This also makes it tricky to use as a spinblocker, as it fears moves such as Hitmonchan's Ice Punch. Finally, Haunter faces competition from Oricorio-G, which boasts access to Calm Mind, better bulk, reliable recovery in Roost, and Dancer to give it an even better matchup against Lilligant.", "Bellsprout": "Bellsprout's Chlorophyll-boosted Speed along with Sleep Powder to work around its checks and Weather Ball to give it strong coverage make it extremely dangerous, and the new generation's addition of Poisonium Z and nerf to Gale Wings only made it stronger. However, Bellsprout's bulk is far from great, and it is almost useless outside of sun teams.", "Tangrowth": "Tangrowth is one of the best pivots in the OU metagame with its great defensive typing in Grass, which allows it to check a number of threats such as Ash-Greninja, Mega Diancie, Garchomp, and Tapu Koko. It can perform as a great wall both physically with its Rocky Helmet set as well as specially with an Assault Vest, which is required for surviving hits from Pokemon like Ash-Greninja. Tangrowth is able to fill these roles well due to Regenerator, allowing it to heal off passive damage while switching, retaining momentum for its teammates while still being able to repeatedly switch into the threats that it needs to check. Despite its general lack of power, Tangrowth has great utility moves such as Knock Off and coverage moves such as Earthquake for Heatran, Hidden Power Ice for Landorus-T, and Hidden Power Fire for Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor. However, Tangrowth is relatively passive and relies on its super effective coverage to be a threat, and the Assault Vest set is prone to Knock Off, which means that it has a much harder time switching into the threats that it needs to check if it loses its Assault Vest.", "Togedemaru": "Togedemaru finds a solid place in NU thanks to its unique type combination that allows it to be a reliable answer to a number of Pokemon in the tier, such as Vivillon, Vikavolt, Alolan Exeggutor, Whimsicott, and Comfey. It differentiates itself from other Steel-type Pokemon in the tier thanks to Wish, giving it longevity other Steel-types like Silvally-Steel, Steelix, and Klinklang lack. Togedemaru can also act as a great pivot with a nice Speed tier that allows it to outspeed most defensive Pokemon with little Speed investment. However, its low natural bulk makes it difficult to switch in, even on resisted hits. Even after investing into its defenses, it often falls short of consistently checking better special attackers in the tier like Alolan Exeggutor.", "Dedenne": "Dedenne's sparse movepool and poor stats bar Speed leave it totally outclassed by other Electric-types such as Alolan Raichu, Eelektross, and Rotom-F. To make matters worse, Dedenne must rely on the unremarkable combination of Petaya Berry + Recycle to accumulate Special Attack boosts, which is a tedious process made especially difficult to pull off in succession given Dedenne's terrible bulk and lack of payoff due to it still being weak even after boosts. Alolan Raichu is a far more consistent boosting sweeper thanks to its superior offensive stats alongside access to Nasty Plot and moves such as Focus Blast and STAB Psyshock, whereas other Electric-types such as Rotom-F and Eelektross also boast far better coverage options.", "Pheromosa": null, "Nosepass": "At first Nosepass may seem like a good pick thanks to its access to Sturdy + Berry Juice and Stealth Rock, which allows it to function as a reliable entry hazard setter. It also has great bulk, and its Flying resistance lets it check the metagame's very threatening Flying-types such as Vullaby and Doduo. Furthermore, its access to Volt Switch is especially useful because it allows Nosepass to pivot out of the two most common hazard removers, Staryu and Kabuto, and access to Thunder Wave differentiates it from other Stealth Rock setters. However, its bad Attack and Speed massively limit its offensive presence, making it passive and somewhat vulnerable to being set up on. It is also outclassed by Onix, which is faster and has a greater Defense stat. Its bad defensive typing gives it weaknesses to common threats like Staryu, Mienfoo, and Pawniard. Overall, Nosepass is generally not worth using.", "Type: Null": "Type: Null is one of the bulkiest Pokemon in PU, blanket checking special attackers such as Lilligant, Mesprit, Swanna, and Jynx. It also has usable physical bulk that not only can be boosted further by Iron Defense but also allows it to check weaker physical attackers like Skuntank, Togedemaru, and Alolan Dugtrio. Although Type: Null's base Speed sits on the lower end of the spectrum, its access to U-turn lets it use said Speed to act as a slow and bulky pivot that creates many opportunities for teammates to be safely brought into the field. Alternatively, Swords Dance makes Type: Null a potent late-game sweeper that uses its defenses to set up with ease, with Battle Armor also coming into play by preventing critical hits, enhancing its sweeping opportunities. Type: Null's nature as a sturdy RestTalk user also makes it very reliable as a status absorber for its team. Unfortunately, Type: Null's reliance on its STAB attacks makes it dependent on Pursuit support to remove Ghost-types, and its Fighting weakness leaves it checked by powerful Pokemon like Gurdurr and Primeape. Furthermore, Eviolite is integral for checking stronger special attackers like Choice Specs Alolan Exeggutor and Aurorus, making Type: Null susceptible to Knock Off and Trick. Type: Null is often on the defensive when it needs to heal, allowing users of Taunt to easily stop it when it tries to use Rest. While it can beat certain Rock- and Steel-types due to them eventually being overpowered by boosted Return and outlasted by Type: Null's recovery, notable exceptions include Lycanroc, Omastar, Carracosta, and Aggron, which can all either use it as setup fodder or break through it firsthand. It can also face competition with other late-game sweepers like Calm Mind Spiritomb and Curse Munchlax, both of which have different typing or abilities that give them resistances or immunities that Type: Null lacks. Regardless, Type: Null is a nice bulky team player with decent role compression for a wide range of playstyles.", "Slaking": "Slaking seems like an appealing option at first glance due to its sky-high Attack stat, great bulk, and expansive movepool. Unfortunately, any sort of viability Slaking could have is completely undermined by Truant, making it immobile every other turn and hopeless against users of Protect and Substitute. This can also be taken advantage of by the opposing team to generate momentum for powerful threats such as Alolan Exeggutor and Crabominable if Slaking predicts incorrectly, and Pokemon such as Gurdurr, Lycanroc, and Omastar can use Slaking as setup fodder. Because of Truant, Slaking has little to no reason to be used over other Normal-types like Stoutland and Kangaskhan.", "Spearow": "Spearow offers little to nothing to distinguish itself from the myriad of Flying-type Pokemon in the tier and struggles to find a place on any serious team as a result. Access to Drill Run is appealing at face value, as it gives Spearow a tool to hit Rock- and Steel-type checks such as Onix and Magnemite hard, but similar Pokemon like Doduo and Rufflet carry moves such as Jump Kick and Superpower to deal with such Pokemon. These two Pokemon are also Spearow's most notable examples of competition, as they boast better offensive stats, access to Brave Bird, more powerful coverage moves, and in Rufflet's case, a far more useful ability in Hustle. Lastly, Spearow's paltry defenses and weaknesses to common Electric-, Rock-, and Ice-type attacks all contribute to its poor longevity.", "Chikorita": "While Chikorita is one of the most bulky Grass-types, it suffers from its shallow movepool and low offensive stats. It is outclassed by other Grass-types like Foongus, which has the ability Regenerator and an additional Poison typing that allows it to check Fighting- and Fairy-types. Due to Bulletproof, Chespin is another pure Grass-type option that is often a better choice than Chikorita because it can effectively check Gastly and Foongus, while also being a much less passive Pokemon overall.", "Scyther": "Scyther has a potent combination of great offensive presence and substantial defensive utility with usable bulk and access to Roost. Its Bug / Flying typing lets it heavily pressure relevant threats like Mesprit, Gurdurr, and Lilligant as well as take on powerful Fighting- and Grass-type attacks from Pokemon like Primeape and Alolan Exeggutor. Scyther is also quite flexible with items; it can run Eviolite to augment its bulk and function as a potent bulky setup sweeper, Choice Scarf to act as a great revenge killer that can punish premier weather threats like Ludicolo, Alolan Sandslash, and Victreebel, and Choice Band to function as a powerful wallbreaker that is efficient at pressuring certain switch-ins like Togedemaru and Oricorio-E. Scyther's great Speed and excellent offensive presence make it a top-notch way to generate momentum for offensive teams with its strong and quick U-turn. However, despite Scyther's strong typing, it is plagued by a severe Stealth Rock weakness that limits its ability in play, although bulky Swords Dance sets with Roost can slightly mitigate this. This same 4x weakness causes it to have difficulty dealing with the prominent Rock-types in the tier, including Regirock, Aggron, and Lycanroc. It also renders Scyther inconsistent in checking many of those same Fighting-type Pokemon it regularly pressures, as well as other Pokemon like Lilligant that can run Rock-type coverage to threaten it. Scyther's other weaknesses include Ice and Electric, leaving it vulnerable to faster Pokemon like Froslass and Choice Scarf Togedemaru. Despite its offensive prowess, Scyther's inability to blast through Pokemon in the way that Aggron and Aurorus can often leaves it reliant on support to deal with physical walls like the aforementioned Regirock, Sableye, Pyukumuku, and Weezing. Regardless, Scyther's offensive and defensive capabilities combined with its good item flexibility give it all the tools it needs to be a potent team player in the PU metagame.", "Honchkrow": "Honchkrow's outstanding offensive typing and extremely high Attack stat allow it to feast on most of the RU metagame as one of the tier's most potent wallbreakers. Its access to a very strong STAB Sucker Punch alongside Pursuit and a fantastic coverage option in Superpower further bolsters its offensive presence. Furthermore, Honchkrow has access to an amazing ability in Moxie, which allows it to become even more threatening upon netting KOs. Honchkrow also sits at a Speed tier that, while not great, is still useful for outpacing the majority of defensive Pokemon in the metagame. However, Honchkrow is weak to Stealth Rock and has horrid defensive stats. Honchkrow also struggles in that it tends to wear itself down quickly due to the harsh recoil damage it will take from both Life Orb and Brave Bird. A lack of access to Knock Off or Crunch forces Honchkrow to use Sucker Punch and Pursuit as its Dark-type STAB attacks, which while useful, can be rather situational and reliant on proper prediction. Lastly, as mentioned before, Honchkrow sits at only a decent Speed tier, which leaves it easily revenge killed and reliant on Sucker Punch to hit fast foes.", "Lycanroc": "Lycanroc is a solid late-game sweeper thanks to its high Attack, stellar Speed tier, and access to a uniquely powerful Z move in Splintered Stormshards. However, it heavily relies on Lycanium Z along with Swords Dance to help break through many of its would-be checks. A somewhat shallow movepool also leaves Lycanroc walled and checked by common Ground- and Fighting-type Pokemon. Additionally, mediocre bulk means Lycanroc can be revenge killed by priority moves and Choice Scarf users like Primeape that aren't threatened by Accelerock.", "Litten": "Litten may have a good ability, but everything else about it is underwhelming in the competitive scene. Its movepool is quite shallow despite its access to useful moves like U-turn, its typing is unimpressive, its stats are average at best, and it's horribly outclassed by other Fire-types such as Ponyta and Larvesta due to their better stats and access to reliable recovery; furthermore, despite being a Fire-type, Litten cannot check Pawniard due to Intimidate activating Defiant. Its lack of coverage and utility options means you're better off using a different Pokemon most of the time.", "Magnezone": "Magnezone's near-exclusive access to Magnet Pull gives it a very unique and valuable niche in the OU metagame as a trapper and eliminator of Steel-types such as Ferrothorn, Scizor, Skarmory, and Celesteela. It also functions as a solid revenge killer with Choice Scarf, being able to check a number of dangerous Pokemon like Kartana, Mega Scizor, and weakened Celesteela. However, its lackluster Speed stat, even with a Choice Scarf, means that it typically struggles to retain its utility after it has trapped what it aims to trap; it is often forced to take a hit before it can attack with its other sets and doesn't have recovery to offset this damage. Its good set of resistances is somewhat undermined by its weakness to three common types in Ground, Fighting, and Fire, which makes it easy for dangerous Pokemon like Mega Lopunny, Landorus-T, and Mega Charizard X to KO and leaves it unable to safely trap Heatran and Excadrill.", "Togetic": null, "Sewaddle": "Sewaddle might look good to use, as it has good bulk and a typing that allows it to set Sticky Web on Water- and Electric-types like Chinchou and Elekid. However, Sewaddle has six weaknesses that makes it hard to rely on it to set up Sticky Web, a low Speed stat, and lacks the ability to threaten its foe due to its low offensive power. Pokemon like Surskit and Dewpider outclass this Pokemon because of their better typing, as Surskit is a better choice for its Speed and Dewpider has a better ability and greater offensive presence, allowing both of these Pokemon more opportunities to get up Sticky Web.", "Vigoroth": "Vigoroth is a fantastic defensive sweeper. Thanks to its great bulk and access to reliable recovery, common offensive Pokemon such as Golem and Choice Scarf Electivire can't 2HKO Vigoroth and therefore are rendered setup fodder. Vigoroth only needs a few EVs to outspeed Monferno and common defensive Pok\u00e9mon such as Altaria and Probopass. This, coupled with Taunt or Substitute, allows Vigoroth to use them as setup fodder as well. However although Vigoroth's bulk is great, if it loses its Eviolite, Vigoroth becomes more specially frail, and giving it a harder time setting up and making it easier to revenge kill. Vigoroth faces competition from the several other Normal-types in ZU, most notably Bulk Up Komala, which, despite being worse at defensive sweping, is far more versatile. Also, Vigoroth doesn't benefit from its pure Normal typing, which doesn't bring it any useful resistances. Vigoroth also can't afford to run anything other than a Normal STAB move as an attack and therefore needs several Attack boosts to break through Pokemon that resist Normal such as Bronzor and Probopass. In addition, Vigoroth is unable to touch Ghost-types such as Gourgeist-XL and Misdreavus and relies on PP stall to beat them. Since Vigoroth needs several turns to set up, it is unable to perform its role if it gets poisoned, making it very vulnerable to Toxic Spikes. Vigoroth is also vulnerable to Trick / Switcheroo from Choice item users, which locks it into one move and prevents it from setting up.", "Palossand": "Palossand is able to carve out a niche for itself in the NU tier thanks to its access to Stealth Rock and reliable recovery in Shore Up. Its Ground / Ghost typing combined with its formidable physical bulk makes it a solid check to Fighting-types such as Medicham and Toxicroak, as well as granting immunities to Normal, Fighting, and Electric and the ability to serve as a spinblocker. Thanks to its STAB Shadow Ball and base 100 Special Attack, Palossand is also one of the few Stealth Rock users in the tier that are able to beat Xatu. Water Compaction also allows Palossand to switch into weaker Water-type moves, such as Samurott's Aqua Jet, and gain a +2 Defense boost. However, due to Palossand's rather poor Special Defense and weakness to many offensive types, it is vulnerable to many of NU's strongest special attackers, namely Alolan Exeggutor, Whimsicott, and Vikavolt. While it has a solid Special Attack stat, it is still very passive and struggles to OHKO even offensive foes. Additionally, Palossand struggles to put its Ghost typing to use for spinblocking, as the only spinner it can really take on is the unviable Hitmontop.", "Quagsire": "Quagsire is a solid defensive wall for balance and stall teams with its passable defenses, great typing, access to reliable recovery, and excellent ability in Unaware. Its bulk and typing enable Quagsire to check the tier's bigger threats, such as Aggron, Lycanroc, and Togedemaru, while Unaware bolsters great matchups against the tier\u2019s multitude of boosting threats such as Gurdurr and Power-Up Punch Kangaskhan. Quagsire can also spread status through Scald burns or Toxic, allowing it to cripple multiple targets throughout a game. It can also run Curse, which lets it function as a bulky late-game sweeper and allows Quagsire to be more immediately threatening. However, Quagsire has a glaring quadruple weakness to Grass and cannot hit many Grass-types such as Alolan Exeggutor and Lurantis for significant damage. This also makes switching into Pokemon with Grass-type coverage like Manectric or Alolan Raichu potentially dangerous for Quagsire. Quagsire variants without Curse can also be passive outside of annoying things with status, having fairly average damage output and constantly being forced to used Recover. Quagsire also dislikes various forms of residual damage such as status and entry hazards, as they hamper its ability to wall threats. Many special wallbreakers pack the strength to break through Quagsire's more lacking special bulk, leaving it open to Pokemon such as Aurorus, Swanna, and Eelektross. Quagsire also receives competition from Pyukumuku as an Unaware wall, but it differentiates itself by having attacking moves and generally a broader movepool, meaning that Quagsire does not automatically fold to Taunt or Substitute.", "Duskull": "Duskull's great Defense and Special Defense coupled with a rather good utility movepool make it look like a considerable utility Pokemon. In actuality, the rest of its stats are very poor, having a limited offensive movepool and no access to recovery. Firstly, Duskull's Ghost typing leaves it weak to the common Knock Off and doesn't give it useful resistances, since almost every Fighting-type carries the move. Duskull is also very passive, which allows setup sweepers that don't mind its moveset, such as Clamperl and Omanyte, to set up on it. As a wall, Duskull is outclassed by the likes of Ferroseed and Mudbray due to its typing and passivity but also because it does nothing useful while walling, whereas Ferroseed can set entry hazards and use Knock Off and Mudbray is hard to switch into. Duskull's lack of reliable recovery hinders its ability to wall as well.", "Masquerain": "Masquerain sports unique access to both Sticky Web and Quiver Dance, which gives it much better offensive presence than other Sticky Web leads such as Smeargle. Masquerain's solid coverage also allows it to threaten Pokemon such as Hitmonchan which give other Sticky Web leads a hard time. However, Masquerain still faces a lot of competition from other Sticky Web setters such as Leavanny and Smeargle due to Leavanny's better Speed and access to valuable support options in Knock Off, Magic Coat, and Electroweb and Smeargle's access to more support options such as Spikes, Spore, and Stealth Rock. As a result of Masquerain's only decent Speed and offensive presence, it is very susceptible to Taunt from Pokemon such as Skuntank, which isn't a problem for the faster Leavanny because it outspeeds Skuntank. Masquerain also has a difficult time against common Defoggers like Silvally-Water that can get rid of Sticky Web with little to no issue. Masquerain's poor bulk and defensive typing don't grant it many opportunities to switch in, meaning that it can only work efficiently as a lead.", "Luvdisc": "Sadly, there is no reason to use the unviable Luvdisc over other Water-types such as Ludicolo, Kabutops, and Omastar. While it has a nice ability in Swift Swim backed with a nice Speed stat, it lacks the firepower to make use of it, often making it dead weight. It also sports a pitiful bulk, leaving it vulnerable to common priority moves, such as Mach Punch and Sucker Punch.", "Aromatisse": "Due to its good offensive typing, access to Trick Room to mitigate its rather low Speed, and access to Nasty Plot to augment its already decent Special Attack, Aromatisse is capable of performing as an effective late-game sweeper that can pose a threat to offensive and defensive teams alike. Aromatisse's typing is solid defensively as well, allowing it to check Pokemon such as Assault Vest Hariyama, Sneasel, and Malamar. This, in combination with its good mixed bulk, gives it an easier time setting Trick Room. Decent coverage in Psychic also allows Aromatisse to deal with Poison-types that would otherwise put a damper on its attempts at sweeping. However, Aromatisse suffers from rather average overall stats, which often forces it to use both Trick Room and Nasty Plot in order to begin sweeping. While good defensively, its pure Fairy typing unfortunately burdens it with weaknesses to Poison- and Steel-type attacks, both of which are fairly common in NU. Aromatisse will often have to take a hit before setting Trick Room for itself, which can be problematic versus stronger attackers such as Mega Glalie, and its susceptibility to all forms of entry hazards making it easier to wear down only makes matters worse.", "Phantump": null, "Gyarados": "Gyarados is a good sweeper in OU due to its access to an excellent boosting move in Dragon Dance alongside solid offensive stats and a sterling offensive typing. It also has two extremely useful abilities in Moxie and Intimidate, which can allow it to snowball and aid it in setting up, respectively. Gyarados's decent bulk and good defensive typing provide it multiple setup opportunities and let it take hits from premier Pokemon in the tier such as Protean Greninja as well as Mega Swampert. However, Gyarados is hurt by its lackluster Speed tier, with Pokemon like Tapu Lele and Kyurem-B outspeeding it before a boost and most common Choice Scarf users and ultra-fast Pokemon like Mega Alakazam outspeeding it after a boost. Gyarados can also run a Mega set, which is notably trickier for some Choice Scarf users such as Garchomp to revenge kill, but it struggles with the prevalence of checks like Tangrowth and Toxapex.", "Axew": "With a high base Attack, decent Speed, and access to Dragon Dance, Axew is able to sweep teams once given the chance to set up. Unfortunately, it struggles against Fairy- and Steel-types when locked into Outrage, though they're vulnerable to Axew's coverage moves. Due to Axew's lack of bulk, powerful offensive Pokemon such as Mienfoo and Vullaby make it hard for it to set up. Because of these factors, even at +1 Axew is often unable to sweep until late-game after the opposing team has been weakened.", "Metapod": null, "Spheal": "Spheal is utterly outclassed as an offensive Water-type due to its terrible stats and unfortunate defensive typing. There are a myriad of far more effective Water-types that should be used instead of Spheal, like Staryu, Mareanie, and Clamperl.", "Bayleef": null, "Heatran": "Heatran is one of the best Pokemon in the tier thanks to an insane typing and great ability in Flash Fire, granting it a number of key immunities and resistances to make it a great check to a number of top-tier Pokemon like Clefable, Ferrothorn, Tornadus-T, Celesteela, and Tapu Lele. It is a fantastic breaker due to a solid base Special Attack stat of 130 and access to a great STAB move in Magma Storm, which when used in tandem with Taunt grants Heatran the invaluable ability to trap and remove passive Pokemon such as Toxapex, Chansey, and Alomomola that would otherwise beat it; furthermore, its Inferno Overdrive can be a nightmare for would-be-checks such as Gliscor, Garchomp, and Ash-Greninja to switch into. These traits make it one of the best Stealth Rock setters in the tier, as it is capable of forcing out foes with its power. However, due to Heatran's prevalence, it can lose to Pokemon it would otherwise check, such as Mega Mawile, Tornadus-T, and Volcarona, due to coverage they run specifically for it. Heatran also unfortunately lacks any form of recovery outside of Leftovers and is vulnerable to both Stealth Rock and Spikes, meaning it can be worn down quite quickly. A middling Speed tier means Heatran is quite easy to force it out with faster Pokemon such as Landorus-T and Ash-Greninja.", "Ponyta": "Ponyta is an extremely potent and versatile threat in the LC metagame thanks to its blazing Speed tier, impressive defensive stats, and workable offenses. Its decent number of viable sets, ranging from utility to offensively oriented, allows it to edge out its competition in the tier's other Fire-types and always leave its opponent guessing, while its fantastic ability in Flame Body allows Ponyta to spread burns and check most physical attackers. Unfortunately, Ponyta's Stealth Rock weakness and vulnerability to Diglett serve as detriments to it given the prevalence of these factors. Furthermore, Ponyta is usually unable to outlast its counters due to the fairly low PP of its only reliable recovery option in Morning Sun.", "Watchog": "Watchog is a poor choice for a Normal-type wallbreaker in the PU metagame, as it is heavily outclassed by Stoutland and Kangaskhan, which possess greater Speed tiers and much more wallbreaking potential. Stoutland and Kangaskhan also have Scrappy to hit opposing Ghost-type Pokemon with their Normal-type moves. On the other hand, Watchog is stuck with Analytic as its best ability, which makes it rely on attacking second; however, with its subpar bulk, it doesn't survive for long.", "Quilava": null, "Taillow": "Taillow is an excellent offensive Pokemon thanks to its two great abilities, Guts and Scrappy, and a base 85 Speed that allows it to outspeed most of the unboosted metagame. It also has extremely powerful STAB attacks in Brave Bird, Facade, and Boomburst. U-turn allows it to play around its checks and whittle them down so it or a teammate can pick them off. However, Taillow is extremely frail and cannot switch into any attack and will faint to most forms of priority. A weakness to Stealth Rock limits the number of times it can switch in. Taillow also does not have many coverage moves, and the ones it does have are not the best. It is heavily outclassed by other birds such as Vullaby and Doduo, which are bulkier or stronger than Taillow is. It has a mediocre Attack stat and a horrible Special Attack stat.", "Hariyama": "Thanks to Thick Fat and Hariyama's respectable bulk, it can serve as an effective check to both Incineroar and Mega Glalie, two of the most threatening wallbreakers in NU, as well as to other Fire- and Ice-type Pokemon like Houndoom, Magmortar, Sneasel, and non-Wood Hammer Mega Abomasnow. Additionally, thanks to Hariyama's great Attack stat, it manages to have an offensive presence while maintaining its solid bulk, allowing it to differentiate itself from other Fire- and Ice-resistant Pokemon like Miltank, Cryogonal, and Alolan Sandslash. Unfortunately, Hariyama faces heavy competition from Passimian, which is also a mono-Fighting-type, checks similar Pokemon to Hariyama offensively, can provide its team with momentum thanks to U-turn, and fits on more teams given its reliability as a Choice Scarf user. Furthermore, Hariyama faces competition as a wallbreaker from Medicham, which is stronger, is faster, and has a secondary typing in Psychic, letting it more easily deal with bulky Poison-types like Garbodor and Golbat. Hariyama fails to check many special attackers like Slowking, Whimsicott, and Vivillon even with the help of Assault Vest, making it unreliable as a catch-all special attack absorber. Hariyama's vulnerability to status like burn and poison further hampers it and forces it to rely on Rest to remain healthy, which means forgoing Assault Vest and thus failing to check strong special attackers like Sceptile, Guzzlord, and Heliolisk. Lastly, Hariyama's poor Speed tier results in it usually being forced to move after the foe, meaning it will likely take a hit or be inflicted with status before it can act.", "Ivysaur": null, "Chingling": "Despite its passable Special Attack and support movepool, Chingling is a mediocre pick on any team; it's not able to excel in any role due to its unfavorable typing, which leaves it weak to common moves such as Knock Off, Pursuit, and U-turn, and its crummy defensive stats, which leave it prone to being overwhelmed by wallbreakers. It is completely outclassed by Slowpoke and Spritzee at any role it attempts.", "Magcargo": "Magcargo has access to a decent utility movepool and has good physical bulk. However, it has a bad HP stat, is weak to all entry hazards, and is prone to being Taunted by the likes of Jellicent and Aggron due to its low Speed. Furthermore, its typing hinders it, as its 4x weakness to Water- and Ground-type attacks make it easy for Jellicent and Mudsdale to take care of Magcargo, and its other weaknesses to Fighting- and Rock-types attacks leave it vulnerable to Pokemon like Gurdurr and Aggron. It is outclassed by Stealth Rock users like Clefairy, Mudsdale, and Regirock because of their better typing, resistance or immunity to Stealth Rock, and better abilities like Magic Guard and Stamina.", "Whiscash": "With access to Dragon Dance, a fairly rare move for Pokemon in PU, and a typing that allows it to resist types that are fairly common in PU, Whiscash may seem like a good choice for a setup sweeper. However, in reality, it has horrible offensive and defensive stats that make it extremely difficult to do damage and seem like a threat. Whiscash\u2019s lack of coverage and severely disappointing stats, even at +1, make it near impossible to sweep an entire team, as its terrible Speed allows it to get revenge killed very easily that makes it very difficult setting up without fainting.", "Vileplume": "Vileplume's incredible defensive typing and access to a wide assortment of utility moves allow it to pivot into and check top-tier threats such as Passimian, Steelix, Heliolisk, and Sceptile. In particular, Vileplume's access to two reliable forms of recovery, Sleep Powder, and Growth enables it to be menacing against offensive and defensive teams alike, and Effect Spore lets Vileplume dissuade Pokemon such as Passimian and Xatu from spamming U-turn. On top of this, Vileplume's high natural Special Attack and Sludge Bomb's chance to poison means Vileplume is considerably less passive than other options and is able to do solid amounts of damage to checks such as Xatu and Incineroar. However, Vileplume's poor Speed and handful of weaknesses to common attacking types mean it fails to hold its own against attackers such as Mega Glalie, Swords Dance Incineroar, and Medicham. In addition, Vileplume's heavy reliance on status moves and lack of coverage options mean it's often setup fodder for the likes of Klinklang, Delphox, and Braviary. Finally, without proper investment, Vileplume can fall short of checking powerful physical attackers such as Swords Dance Torterra and Choice Band Dhelmise.", "Slowking": "Thanks to its great special bulk in tandem with Regenerator, an Assault Vest, and its typing, Slowking is a solid special wall capable of taking on strong special attackers like Heliolisk, Whimsicott, and Magmortar. Unlike other defensive Pokemon, Slowking's solid Special Attack alongside its great coverage options means it isn't passive, making it harder for Pokemon like Heliolisk, Sneasel, and Dhelmise to take advantage of. Unfortunately, Slowking faces competition from other bulky Water-types like Vaporeon and Seismitoad that can provide more utility to their team in the form of cleric and entry hazard support, respectively. Slowking's typing and poor physical bulk also leave it prone to being Pursuit trapped by Pokemon such as Sneasel, Absol, and Aerodactyl, an issue other bulky Water-types struggle with far less.", "Dustox": "With its two 4x resistances to Grass and Fighting, an immunity to Toxic, and access to both Quiver Dance and Iron Defense, Dustox can slowly turn into a setup sweeper. However, its typing brings forth several notable weaknesses, most notably to Psychic, Flying, and Rock, that allow Dustox to be overcome by threats such as Mesprit, Dodrio, and Aggron. Dustox also faces fierce competition from Bellossom as a bulky Quiver Dance sweeper, as Bellossom has better offensive stats as well as Strength Sap to restore its health while lowering the target's Attack.", "Lopunny": "Mega Lopunny possesses an amazing Speed stat that lets it outpace most of the unboosted metagame, thus making it an excellent revenge killer. Furthermore, Lopunny's high-Base Power STAB moves give it perfect coverage thanks to its ability Scrappy, which, when backed up by its great Attack stat, let it pose a threat to slower offensive threats that lack the bulk to take its attacks, like Greninja and Tapu Koko. On top of that, Lopunny has access to a wide supportive movepool consisting of moves like Encore and Power-Up Punch that helps it take on bulkier Pokemon it struggles against, such as Clefable and Toxapex. Additionally, STAB Fake Out is another great asset that lets Lopunny pick off weakened Pokemon that outspeed it such as Mega Alakazam. However, Lopunny lacks the immediate power to break through some of the bulkier Pokemon in the metagame such as Mew and Toxapex, which forces it to rely on Power-Up Punch and Encore to pose a threat to defensive teams. Despite Lopunny's good matchup against offense, it can be easily overwhelmed by residual damage from entry hazards, weather conditions, and Rocky Helmet from the likes of Tornadus-T and Tank Chomp, which leaves it vulnerable to priority moves like Ash-Greninja's Water Shuriken and Weavile's Ice Shard.", "Charjabug": null, "Vanilluxe": "Snow Warning allows Vanilluxe to power off extremely powerful Blizzards, which can quickly dismantle teams lacking a sturdy Steel-type such as Registeel. A decent Speed tier puts it above many metagame threats, particularly Mega Blastoise, as well as other Pokemon like Nidoqueen, Feraligatr, and Tyrantrum. Blizzard + Freeze-Dry + Hidden Power Fire allows Vanilluxe to hit the majority of the tier for at least neutral damage, only missing out on Fire-types. It also has utility in Taunt that lets it prevent walls like Bronzong from setting up entry hazards and priority in the form of Ice Shard that lets it remove Pokemon like Noivern more easily. Despite this, Vanilluxe fails to make headway against the plethora of teams running sturdy Steel-types such as Registeel and Bronzong. Even against bulky offense, Vanilluxe will struggle to make immediate progress, as it'll have to worry about getting through other Steel-types like Metagross, and its mediocre defenses combined with an abysmal defensive typing leaves it vulnerable to faster bulky offense staples such as Virizion and Salazzle. Vanilluxe's underwhelming Special Attack stat means that all of its attacks bar Blizzard will be lacking. Vanilluxe is also worn down quickly by residual damage, especially Stealth Rock due to its typing, and it struggles to switch into weak attacks because of its mediocre bulk and bad defensive typing.", "Beldum": null, "Bastiodon": "Bastiodon may appear to be a decent choice on bulkier builds due to its humongous defensive stats, but its awful defensive typing leaves it massively susceptible to the Fighting-types in the tier. A lot of strong physical wallbreakers in the tier currently carry Fighting coverage too, which doesn't do Bastiodon any favors. Pokemon that share Bastiodon's typing like Aggron and Probopass have ways to mitigate their typing's flaws, as Aggron is a strong wallbreaker and Probopass can trap Steel-types, has a decent offensive presence, and can pivot. Bastiodon is also very passive, which leaves it shut down by every Taunt user in the tier.", "Sandshrew": "With its new Alolan forme, the original Sandshrew has been greatly overshadowed, even more than it already was, in fact. However, Sandshrew can still use Knock Off and has a much better defensive typing. It is also largely outclassed by Drilbur in its role as a Stealth Rock and Rapid Spin user, though it has a higher Defense stat and access to the previously mentioned Knock Off. Furthermore, with the rise of Staryu, Sandshrew has become even more niche due to Staryu's ability to clear away Sandshrew's hazards and completely force it out with the threat of a Scald.", "Mudbray": "Thanks to an excellent defensive ability in Stamina as well as good defensive stats, Mudbray is one of the best defensive Pokemon in Little Cup. It also has an incredible base 100 Attack stat as well as excellent physical coverage, allowing it to run a viable offensive set as well. Even with no investment, it still reaches an impressive 17 Attack, meaning defensive sets are still not passive at all. Additionally, even though it is slow, it can reach 14 Speed without a Jolly nature, meaning it can run a Choice Scarf set to catch its opponents off guard.", "Carvanha": "Carvanha is the epitome of a glass cannon, with great offensive potential and almost nonexistent defensive abilities. With Speed Boost, Carvanha quickly becomes hard to outspeed, which generally can act to offset its paper-like defenses. However, Carvanha is reliant on KOing the opposition, as otherwise it is KOed in return. Thankfully, this is not too much of an issue, with Carvanha having two excellent STAB attacks and decent coverage options to support them. This makes Carvanha pretty hard to wall, especially considering its ability to act as either a physical or special attacker.", "Shroomish": "Shroomish's nice defensive stats and access to Spore seem appealing, but it is largely outclassed by the ubiquitous Foongus. The only things Shroomish has over Foongus are a resistance to Ground-type moves and a better physical movepool with Drain Punch to hit Pawniard and Ferroseed, which isn't a great trade because Foongus has an absurd ability in Regenerator and a resistance to Fighting. Shroomish is also rendered passive by a majority of the tier due to its inability to damage Flying-, Fire-, and Poison-types, especially after it already put a Pokemon to sleep.", "Venomoth": "Albeit uncommon, Venomoth is among UU's most potent sweepers thanks to its access to Quiver Dance, Sleep Powder, and an amazing ability in Tinted Lens, which severely limits its checks. The advent of Z-Moves allows Venomoth to further bolster its sweeping prowess, as it can use Savage Spin-Out to break past Pokemon capable of tanking a +1 Bug Buzz like Scizor, Gliscor, and Terrakion. Venomoth also possesses key resistances to the tier's common Fairy- and Fighting-type attacks, which grants it plentiful opportunities to force switches and set up. Unfortunately, despite its useful resistances, Venomoth's typing also leaves it with a Stealth Rock weakness and with vulnerabilities to common attack types in Fire, Flying, and Psychic. Venomoth is also cursed with horrid bulk, which can complicate setup and leave it vulnerable to common Choice Scarf users in Infernape, Krookodile, and Terrakion. Venomoth can also struggle due to its occasionally underwhelming power after one Quiver Dance boost, which may leave it reliant on setting up a second time or using its Z-Move too early.", "Hawlucha": "Hawlucha is a very threatening sweeper with the combination of a terrain seed such as Electric Seed, Grassy Seed, or Psychic Seed and the Unburden ability, capable of outspeeding even extremely fast foes, such as all common Choice Scarf users, Mega Alakazam, and sweepers such as Shift Gear Magearna and Mega Swampert. Additionally, it can threaten out many defensive Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Tangrowth, and Mega Venusaur by virtue of its offensive typing. Hawlucha is also able to setup on defensive variants of Landorus-T, which is found on nearly every team. Its relatively low base Attack leaves it unable to OHKO foes such as Latios without a Swords Dance boost and even more defensive Pokemon such as Toxapex and Mew after a Swords Dance boost. It is also prone to being revenge killed by strong priority moves, such as Mega Pinsir's Quick Attack or Ash-Greninja's Water Shuriken.", "Delibird": "Delibird is an atrocious Pokemon, being outclassed by virtually every other lead in the game due to its abysmal Speed and defenses, meaning it will rarely ever be able to set up more than one layer of Spikes. Even though it's able to run Rapid Spin in an attempt to win the hazard game, Froslass and Qwilfish are more effective at keeping entry hazards off the field due to their superior Speed and access to Taunt; the former's ability to spinblock and the latter's defensive utility in Intimidate contribute to making them far more reliable options.", "Furret": "Furret is entirely outclassed by other Normal-type Pokemon in the tier offensively and defensively. This is because all of Furret's stats except Speed are too low to make it a viable Pokemon in PU. Examples of better Normal-type offensive Pokemon in the tier are Kangaskhan and Stoutland, as they have better offensive stats and abilities.", "Whimsicott": "Whimsicott can be a major nuisance to both offensive and balance teams alike due to its fantastic Speed stat, passable Special Attack, and well-rounded coverage. Its unique Grass / Fairy typing gives it a plethora of resistances, allowing it to soft check Pokemon such as Vaporeon, Malamar, Scrafty, Passimian, and Guzzlord on offensive teams. Moreover, Whimsicott is also the best form of entry hazard removal on offense with Prankster Defog and great STAB moves to break past common hazard setters such as Druddigon, Seismitoad, Rhydon, and Piloswine. Unfortunately, Whimsicott has a rather average Special Attack stat, thus leaving it helpless against particularly bulky walls like Mega Audino, Type: Null, and Torterra. Whimsicott is also somewhat frail, meaning it is easily revenged killed by most Choice Scarf users like Delphox, Braviary, and Sigilyph as well as Sneasel with Ice Shard.", "Larvitar": "Larvitar has a great offensive STAB combination that hits almost the entire tier for neutral damage, as well as access to a great setup option in Dragon Dance, which allows it to pose a threat as a decent late-game sweeper. Larvitar's Guts ability further bolsters its offensive presence and allows it to absorb status fairly well and set up without worrying about burns. In addition to its unresisted STAB attacks, Larvitar also has access to powerful coverage options like Superpower and Crunch to hit specific targets harder. However, despite its typing's excellent offensive STAB coverage, it also leaves Larvitar 4x weak to the tier's common Grass- and Water-type attacks and weak to the ever so prevalent Fighting-types. Larvitar is also quite slow before a boost and very frail, meaning that it will struggle to take a hit before setting up, and even after a boost, Larvitar's low Speed and weaknesses to common priority attacks like Aqua Jet and Vacuum Wave leave it easily revenge killed. Furthermore, Larvitar is still quite slow and weak after a boost, meaning that it will be easily revenge killed by most moderately bulky foes. Lastly, Larvitar faces competition from a similar sweeper in Tyrunt, which has a better typing and ability for setting up and a higher Attack stat, and from Shell Smash users like Shellder and Tirtouga.", "Medicham": "Pure Power doubles Mega Medicham's Attack stat, making it one of the most powerful wallbreakers in the OU tier. Powerful STAB attacks in High Jump Kick and Zen Headbutt in conjunction with solid coverage moves such as Thunder Punch and Ice Punch make Mega Medicham even more challenging to switch into. Mega Medicham's base 100 Speed stat allows it to outpace Heatran, Rotom-W, Tapu Lele, and Landorus-T, among other threatening Pokemon. Mega Medicham also has access to priority moves such as Fake Out and Bullet Punch, which help patch up its only decent Speed stat and allow it to pick off faster offensive Pokemon such as Greninja, Tapu Koko, and Gengar. Mega Medicham's relatively low Speed stat alongside very poor bulk makes it rather easy to revenge kill. Despite Mega Medicham's power, it has issues breaking through bulky Psychic-types such as the prevalent Mew, as well as Reuniclus and Mega Slowbro.", "Rotom-Frost": "Rotom-F is a solid offensive threat by virtue of its decent stats, diverse utility movepool, and potent STAB combination that targets the majority of the tier neutrally or super effectively. Most notably, Rotom-F makes for an effective user of Defog, as it bears a fantastic matchup against common entry hazard setters such as Mudsdale, Mesprit, and Qwilfish. Rotom-F's Speed tier is also of value, as it puts it above prominent Pokemon such as Stoutland, Skuntank, and the previously mentioned Mesprit, making it highly threatening against bulky offense teams without proper switch-ins. Unfortunately, the Pokemon that do outspeed Rotom-F, such as Lycanroc, Primeape, and Simisear, are all considerable threats, as they possess super effective STAB moves against it. Additionally, while Levitate grants Rotom-F an immunity to Spikes and Toxic Spikes, a weakness to Stealth Rock combined with its low HP and inconsistent forms of recovery harms its viability as a Defog user, limiting what it can come in on if Stealth Rock is up. Lastly, though Rotom-F can pivot out of most unfavorable matchups with Volt Switch, it struggles to break past most specially bulky Pokemon such as Type: Null, Clefairy, and Audino. Lanturn notably serves as a complete stop to Rotom-F due to its resistance to Blizzard and ability to punish Volt Switch with Volt Absorb.", "Guzzlord": "Guzzlord is a threatening wallbreaker in NU that is capable of easily exploiting common defensive cores revolving around Pokemon such as Slowking, Steelix, and Golbat due to good defensive presence courtesy of its typing and massive HP. As a result of its defensive capabilities, Guzzlord can also take on certain offensive Pokemon such as Incineroar, Houndoom, and Rotom, giving it multiple opportunities to switch in and heavily pressure opposing teams. Stellar offensive typing, high Special Attack, Beast Boost, and vast coverage options also give Guzzlord great offensive presence, allowing it to hit everything in the tier neutrally and powerfully. However, Guzzlord's horribly low Speed leaves it outpaced by almost every offensive Pokemon in the tier. While Guzzlord's typing does provide it with key resistances to Electric, Water, Fire, and Grass as well as an immunity to Psychic, it also leaves Guzzlord vulnerable to Fairy-, Fighting-, Ice-, and Bug-type Pokemon like Whimsicott, Passimian, Mega Glalie, and Vikavolt. Guzzlord's typing also leaves it susceptible to coverage options from Pokemon it could otherwise switch into with ease, such as U-turn on Incineroar, Low Sweep on Decidueye, Focus Blast on Heliolisk, and Dazzling Gleam on Delphox.", "Golbat": "With its excellent bulk with Eviolite, great defensive typing, and reliable recovery, Golbat finds its place on teams that require checks to offensive Pokemon like Sceptile and Passimian. Additionally, the utility that Defog offers gives it a place on teams that require entry hazard control. Golbat possesses a great Speed tier, allowing it to outspeed and deal with threats like Decidueye and Medicham. Utility options in Super Fang, Toxic, and Taunt offer Golbat a wide range of stallbreaking options against Pokemon like Vaporeon, Mega Audino, and Silvally-Steel. However, Golbat's weakness to Stealth Rock leaves it susceptible to being pressured and forced to Roost frequently, which also makes it less effective as a hazard remover. Golbat's heavy reliance on Eviolite leaves it vulnerable to being exploited by Pokemon it used to be able to check, like Sceptile and Fighting-types, when it has been hit by Knock Off. Golbat's passive nature leaves it prone to being pivoted on and taken advantage of by Pokemon like Steelix, Klinklang, and Rotom.", "Gengar": null, "Bouffalant": "Bouffalant carves a small niche in PU thanks to its solid bulk, high base Attack, and access to Sap Sipper, giving it opportunities to set up on Pokemon like Clefairy, break down balance teams, and blanket check Grass-type Pokemon like Lilligant and Victreebel. However, Bouffalant faces heavy competition from other Normal-type wallbreakers such as Stoutland and Kangashan, which are stronger, are faster, and don't struggle as much against bulky walls like Quagsire. Dodrio and Alolan Raticate also serve as better offensive Swords Dance users, while Type: Null and Drampa have better bulk and access to reliable recovery. Additionally, Bouffalant tends to be complete setup bait for Ghost-types like Oricorio-G and Haunter and struggles against prevalent Ghost-types like Sabelye and Jellicent. Furthermore, Bouffalant lacks reliable recovery, meaning it can be worn down quickly between entry hazards and losing HP from setting up Substitute. Its low Speed also means that it will have to take a hit before firing off an attack or setting up a Substitute. Lastly, Bouffalant's Normal typing leaves it with almost no resistances other than an immunity to Grass thanks to Sap Sipper and leaves it weak to common Fighting-types and strong physical attackers that carry super effective coverage moves like Gurdurr, Primeape, Absol, and Aggron.", "Chimecho": "On paper, Chimecho has a lot of things going for it. It has a solid support movepool, including reliable recovery in Recover, entry hazard removal in Defog, and rare access to Healing Wish. It also has a solid ability in Levitate, making it a pivot into certain Pokemon such as Mudsdale. However, this all falls apart when one looks at Chimecho's stats and typing, which are pretty bad for the type of Pokemon it is supposed to be. There are plenty of Psychic-type in the tier which provide similar utility while still being vastly more competent choices, such as Mesprit and Claydol. They also have ways against the Dark-types that counter Chimecho such as pivoting with U-turn or Healing Wish or using Choice Specs Dazzling Gleam and Ground-type STAB moves.", "Pyroar": "Despite being the fastest Fire-type NU has to offer, Pyroar has failed to make an impression on the metagame due to its poor non-STAB coverage options and minimal defensive utility. Against Pokemon such as Slowking, Regirock, and Rhydon, Pyroar has to rely on Grassium Z + Solar Beam, whereas other Fire-types have more consistent coverage that can wear down their checks more easily. For reference, Incineroar OHKOes both of them after a Swords Dance boost with either Knock Off or Tectonic Rage, and Magmortar OHKOes defensive Slowking with Thunderbolt-based Gigavolt Havoc, all after Stealth Rock. Bad bulk and a bad defensive typing dissuade it from ever directly switching into anything other than Ghost attacks, whereas Incineroar and Magmortar have Intimidate and a secondary Dark typing for the former and a high Special Defense stat for the latter. We're not lion, Pyroar struggles to distinguish itself from the plethora of other Fire-types NU has to choose from.", "Dewpider": "Dewpider is a very bulky Sticky Web setter able to easily switch in on many Fighting-, Ground-, Water-, and Fire-types such as Timburr, Mudbray, Corphish, and Ponyta to set up the entry hazard. An amazing ability in Water Bubble lets Dewpider threaten a large portion of the metagame with its Water-type attacks while preventing burns and halving Fire damage. Dewpider also has a nice movepool that includes Magic Coat to bounce back status moves like entry hazards and potentially function as a lead, Scald to burn and cripple physical attackers, and Giga Drain to hit Water-types and restore some HP. However, while Dewpider's typing grants it good resistances, it also leaves it vulnerable to common Flying-types like Vullaby and Doduo, which not only beat Dewpider but also are unaffected by Sticky Web's Speed reduction, Electric-types such as Chinchou and Elekid, Rock-types, and especially Stealth Rock, which chips away a quarter of its HP as it switches in. Dewpider's Stealth Rock weakness is compounded by its lack of consistent recovery and low Speed stat before Sticky Web is up, making it worn down pretty easily. Its low Speed also makes it face competition with Surskit as a Sticky Web setter, as Surskit's greater Speed lets it set up more consistently. Lastly, the prevalence of Snivy and Pawniard in the metagame make it hard to use Dewpider effectively, as they both have abilities that punish Sticky Web, with Snivy even being able to clear entry hazards with Defog.", "Blitzle": "Despite decent offensive stats, Blitzle is outclassed by other Electric-types, namely Elekid, which is faster, has a higher Special Attack stat, and has a more diverse movepool. Blitzle is able to check Snivy, which is the only reason to use it over other Electric-types. Even still, Blitzle is not able to reliably check Snivy due due to its relative frailty and lack of recovery, meaning it is easily chipped down by entry hazards and Snivy's coverage moves such as Hidden Power Ground. Additionally, Blitzle is extremely frail and not particularly strong, leaving it easily revenge killed.", "Primarina": "Primarina is a fearsome wallbreaker in the UU tier, possessing a high Special Attack stat that is complemented nicely by its fantastic offensive and defensive typing in Water / Fairy. Its typing along with its solid natural special bulk allows it to reliably handle Hydreigon as well as stomach hits from threats like Moltres, Chandelure, and Mega Pidgeot and KO in return. However, Primarina is ultimately held back by its lackluster Defense stat, worsening its one-on-one matchup against common Pokemon like Mega Aerodactyl, Scizor, and Dragon Dance Mega Altaria. Additionally, due to its low Speed stat, Primarina is often forced to take damage in order to get off attacks of its own, ultimately limiting its longevity in combination with its vulnerability to all entry hazards.", "Braviary": "Braviary can effectively perform the role of a wallbreaker, late-game sweeper, or revenge killer thanks to its access to utility moves like Bulk Up and U-turn, above average Speed, and great Attack. In addition, its great coverage between just Brave Bird and Superpower leaves it walled by very few Pokemon, meaning it can be very difficult to answer defensively. Braviary can also provide great support for its team, since U-turn lets it bring in dangerous wallbreakers, while its ability Defiant dissuades and punishes the use of Defog. Additionally, the sheer special bulk of the Substitute + Bulk Up set lets Braviary check Grass-types like Sceptile and Whimsicott as well as other special attackers like Guzzlord and Accelgor. Unfortunately, Bulk Up variants of Braviary are easy to check defensively with Pokemon such as Rhydon and Steelix and rely on moves that cut into their longevity, leaving them more easily revenge killed. Choice Scarf Braviary is harder to revenge kill but is much weaker, since it cannot boost. Braviary also deals with a weakness to Stealth Rock, limiting the number of turns it can safely switch in before having to recover with Roost and thus providing the foe with a free turn. Faster offensive Pokemon like Heliolisk and Mega Glalie also give Braviary problems, as they can easily take advantage of Braviary's lesser Speed and OHKO it.", "Lumineon": "Lumineon has very few reasons to be used over other Water-type Defog users like Silvally-Water and Swanna. Silvally-Water has higher stats all around while still being able to serve as a defensive wall and pivot, while Swanna has reliable recovery and offers more offensive pressure with its secondary typing. Bar its decent Speed tier, Lumineon possesses mediocre stats that give it trouble switching into moves and dealing any offensive damage. Its lack of reliable recovery furthers this, as well as its susceptibility to all entry hazards and weakness to Toxic from hazard setters like Regirock and Alolan Sandslash, which leads to Lumineon struggling as a Defogger.", "Spoink": null, "Finneon": "Finneon's main niche is being a Defogger that is not weak to Stealth Rock, with the ability to beat common Stealth Rock users such as Onix and Dwebble with its Water-type moves. It has U-turn to set itself apart from other Water-type entry hazard removers, which allows Finneon to pivot its teammates in and gain momentum. Finneon's good defense stats make it quite bulky, giving it more opportunities to use Defog, and its access to Scald allows it to cripple physical attackers with burns, providing even more utility. Storm Drain gives Finneon more opportunities to switch in, particularly letting it switch into Water-type attacks without taking any damage while obtaining a Special Attack boost. However, because Finneon lacks any sort of reliable recovery, it is quite easy to wear down. It is generally very passive due to its poor Special Attack stat, making it rely on Scald burns to mitigate this. It lacks a lot of coverage moves and usually goes in a pattern in move choice, leaving it predictable. Lastly, it faces competition from Staryu and Kabuto as a hazard remover due to their access to reliable recovery and greater consistency.", "Elgyem": "Although it resists Fighting and has decent bulk, Elgyem has difficulty differentiating itself from Spritzee, an overall better offensive Trick Room user. Possessing a weakness to Knock Off and Sucker Punch is detrimental for Elgyem, especially compared to Spritzee\u2019s resistance to Dark, and having to resort to Hidden Power to hit said Dark-types diminishes Elgyem\u2019s offensive presence. Becoming Pursuit trapped by Pokemon such as Alolan Grimer is also annoying for Elgyem. Even Solosis, although it's not viable either, is better than Elgyem in performing this role due to Magic Guard and a higher Special Attack stat. While Elgyem is a better check to Abra than Spritzee and Analytic is quite a useful ability to for it to have, its ability works against itself under Trick Room, and Elgyem's strengths pale in comparison to the overwhelming number of advantages Spritzee has over it as an offensive Trick Room setter.", "Pichu": "Pichu is an extraordinarily bad Pokemon in the LC tier, with terrible bulk and attacking stats combined with a bad movepool and average Speed. There is no reason to use Pichu over other Electric-type Pokemon such as Elekid and Chinchou that work far better offensively and defensively. Its only real desirable aspects come in the form of Fake Out and Volt Tackle, but even though these are useful moves, they do little damage with Pichu's poor stats. Pichu should not be used on any LC team.", "Tapu Lele": "Tapu Lele easily sets itself apart from a jungle of powerful wallbreakers in OU due to its unique and utile ability: Psychic Surge. Said ability sets Psychic Terrain automatically, boosting Tapu Lele's Psychic-type attacks for free and making them wickedly difficult to tank or switch into directly. The Terrain also protects grounded Pok\u00e9mon from priority attacks; as many priority users such as Mega Mawile, Ash-Greninja, and Mega Scizor rely on their respective attacks to stop faster threats, Tapu Lele can limit their actions and allow itself or teammates to completely overpower these threats. With these traits combined with great offensive stats and a good typing, Tapu Lele is a frightening force of nature, capable of utterly breaking numerous team archetypes while boasting unique threat coverage along with downright scary flexibility in its item and set usage. However, Tapu Lele dislikes the fact that many bulky Steel-types, especially Magearna and Celesteela, can easily switch into both of its STAB attacks. The coverage attacks it usually runs to address them as well as other checks and counters tend to be too weak or shaky to use consistently without fair prediction or prior damage. Tapu Lele's average physical bulk and good\u2014but not fantastic\u2014Speed also tend to hold it back, making it often vulnerable to revenge killing. Regardless, as Tapu Lele is always rather unforgiving in its power and versatility, all team archetypes must exercise caution against it.", "Rotom-Fan": "Rotom-S has a niche because of its good defensive Electric / Flying typing, which gives it the ability to check common threats such as Oricorio-G, Gurdurr, Scyther, and Swanna. Its movepool, which includes moves such as Will-O-Wisp and Defog, gives it some more utility as a defensive Pokemon. Although it's one of the few relevant hazard removers that are immune to both Spikes and Toxic Spikes, its weakness to Stealth Rock and lack of reliable recovery hinder its ability to switch in, which interferes with its role as a Defogger. In addition, it's pressured by common hazard setters like Froslass and Focus Sash Omastar. Weaknesses to prevalent Rock- and Ice-type moves further undermine its ability to check standard Fighting-types like Primeape and Hitmonchan. Furthermore, Oricorio-E is another notable adversary; despite Oricorio-E's slightly lower bulk, Taunt is its main selling point over Rotom-S, permitting Oricorio-E to shut down defensive hazard setters such as Weezing \u2013 something Rotom-S cannot do. On the offensive side, it is likewise overshadowed by Oricorio-E due to the latter's access to Hurricane, Roost, Taunt, Calm Mind, as well as Defog. As an offensive pivot, it is outclassed by Eelektross and Rotom-F, which have more coverage options that can be used to threaten counters. As a result of its numerous flaws, Rotom-S is often considered to be an unconventional Electric-type pick in general, but it finds a small place in the tier with its typing and defensive capability. It also faces competition from Lanturn, as Lanturn has an immunity to Electric-type moves and a resistance to Ice-type moves, greater special bulk, and access to Heal Bell. It should be kept in mind that having both Will-O-Wisp and Defog on the same moveset is Rotom-S's only niche over the previously mentioned Pokemon and is, for the most part, the only reason to use it.", "Amaura": "By virtue of its amazing offensive typing, which offers unresisted coverage alongside Earth Power, Amaura secures itself a niche in LC as a good offensive check to Flying-types and as a potent revenge killer with a Choice Scarf. Its access to two good abilities in Snow Warning, which grants it a 100% accurate Blizzard and chip damage on foes, and Refrigerate, which provides Amaura with an immensely powerful Hyper Voice and the ability to bypass Substitute, further bolsters its offensive presence. Furthermore, Amaura has a rather diverse special movepool, with access to useful moves like Thunderbolt, Earth Power, and Flash Cannon in addition to its STAB moves, which allows it to sufficiently cover most of the metagame. Unfortunately, despite its offensive prowess, Amaura has an absolutely awful defensive typing, with 4x weaknesses to Fighting- and Steel-type attacks, weaknesses to common priority moves such as Aqua Jet and Vacuum Wave, and a weakness to Stealth Rock. Amaura is also hurt by its poor Speed, which leaves it either reliant on a Choice Scarf to outspeed foes, or outsped and threatened by common Pokemon such as Mienfoo, Pawniard, and Diglett. Lastly, Amaura suffers from a general lack of power behind any of its Rock-type STAB attacks, which keeps it from hitting too hard with them unless used against targets that take super effective damage and at times can also limit its overall neutral coverage.", "Crustle": "Crustle is a decent suicide lead on hyper offense teams thanks to its ability to set up both Stealth Rock and Spikes, a feature lacking in most other lead Pokemon. Additionally, Crustle packs nifty moves in Rock Blast and Knock Off, which are very effective against opposing leads like Shuckle and Ferroseed. Crustle has two useful abilities that solidify its role as an entry hazard setter, with Sturdy letting it survive at least one attack and Weak Armor letting it take advantage of physical attackers by receiving a Speed boost when hit, allowing Crustle to outspeed most of them and set up another hazard the following turn. However, Crustle's selection of coverage moves is rather lacking, often making it setup fodder to bulkier Pokemon such as Carracosta and Alolan Sandslash. Crustle is also very slow and generally passive, which makes it vulnerable to Taunt users such as Alolan Persian and Misdreavus. Special attackers in particular are a pain for it, as Crustle has mediocre Special Defense, and special attacks do not activate Weak Armor. Crustle faces competition as a hazard setter from Pokemon such as Aurorus and Aggron, which can apply offensive pressure alongside setting up Stealth Rock. Lastly, Crustle is quite one-dimensional and predictable, as it's outclassed in other roles like a Shell Smash sweeper and a fully defensive wall by Pokemon like Carracosta and Regirock, respectively.", "Weavile": "Weavile's solid attacking stats and offensive typing make it a big threat to offensive teams, as it can outspeed and heavily damage threats like Tornadus-T, Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Serperior. In addition, great STAB moves such as Knock Off, Ice Shard, and Pursuit ensure Weavile will almost never be dead weight in any matchup, as it can provide utility in several ways against several team archetypes. However, Weavile's typing is awful defensively, granting it a Stealth Rock weakness as well as weaknesses to common types like Fairy, Fighting, and Steel. Said typing also means Weavile will set up on by dangerous threats like Mega Mawile, Volcarona, Z-Move Magearna, and Mega Scizor if not used carefully.", "Gothita": null, "Magby": "Magby is a great offensive threat due to many good traits. Thanks to Magby's excellent Speed tier, it outspeeds threats such as Gastly and Doduo. Magby's great attacking stats let it hit most of the metagame hard. It also has a decent movepool, with priority in the form of Mach Punch, reliable STAB attacks such as Fire Punch, and Belly Drum to help it sweep. Thanks to Vital Spirit, it is immune to sleep-inducing moves such as Foongus's Spore. Unfortunately, Magby is super frail and weak to Stealth Rock, causing it to get worn down quickly. It also faces competition from several offensive Fire-types, such as Ponyta, Houndour, and Larvesta, and it also has trouble setting up due to its frailty.", "Smeargle": null, "Gigalith": "Gigalith's access to Sand Stream, which boosts its Special Defense by 50%, makes it an extremely durable Pokemon with its base 85 / 130 / 80 bulk. Sand Stream is the biggest factor in making Gigalith a good Pokemon, as it makes Stoutland an incredible threat, removes sun, hinders moves such as Synthesis and Moonlight, and provides chip damage that can be an annoyance to the opponent (but to the user as well). Gigalith's movepool is also diverse enough with access to moves such as Stealth Rock, making it one of the most effective users of it, along with Stone Edge, Rock Blast, and Earthquake. In addition, with its Rock typing and incredible defenses, Gigalith makes for a good check against a number of threats such as Swellow, Salazzle, Dragalge, Stoutland, and Ninetales. All that said, its typing also gives it a weakness to the common Water- and Ground-types in the tier such as Slowbro, Milotic, Rhyperior, and Flygon. Additionally, Gigalith is pitifully slow, has no recovery outside of Leftovers, and has to compete with other Rock-types in the tier, including Rhyperior, which can be more hard hitting, and Diancie, which has more utility with its Fairy typing and access to Heal Bell.", "Keldeo": "Keldeo's solid Special Attack and Speed stat allow it to function as a solid balance breaker in the OU tier. A Water / Fighting typing in conjunction with solid bulk for an offensive Pokemon allows Keldeo to check threatening Water-, Fire-, Steel-, and Dark-type Pokemon such as Ash-Greninja, Heatran, Mega Scizor, Tyranitar, and Weavile. Keldeo's STAB Secret Sword also allows it to bypass traditional checks to special attacking Water-types such as Chansey and Ferrothorn. Unfortunately, not all shines for Keldeo, as numerous Pokemon such as Toxapex, Amoonguss, and Tapu Fini are all hard counters to most Keldeo sets. Keldeo also lacks any powerful coverage options and is forced to rely on weaker moves such as Hidden Power and Icy Wind.", "Manectric": "Mega Manectric is one of the best offensive pivots and revenge killers in the metagame, and it is one of the best Mega Evolutions for VoltTurn teams. It is one of the fastest Pokemon in the tier, only being outsped by Mega Sceptile, Mega Beedrill, Mega Aerodactyl, and Choice Scarf users. Its access to strong Fire-type coverage moves like Overheat and Flamethrower and to Hidden Power Ice lets it pressure many of the Pokemon that resist or are immune to Volt Switch like Celebi, Mega Steelix, and Hydreigon, which increases its overall effectiveness as an offensive pivot. Mega Manectric's ability Intimidate also contributes heavily to its success because it allows Mega Manectric to more easily take priority attacks like Scizor's Bullet Punch and Mamoswine's Ice Shard when revenge killing foes. Mega Manectric's typing allows it to heavily threaten opposing Water- and Flying-types like Moltres, Mega Slowbro, and Tentacruel while also giving it some useful resistances that let it more easily take on Steel-types like Scizor and Klefki. However, its typing also gives it a weakness to Ground-type attacks from Pokemon like Krookodile, Hippowdon, and Mega Aerodactyl. In addition, its extremely subpar bulk and lack of recovery make Mega Manectric easily taken out by Choice Scarf users like Latias, Infernape, and Hydreigon if it takes too much residual damage.", "Bruxish": "Bruxish is an extremely potent and threatening attacker in the RU metagame thanks to its plethora of valuable offensive traits. Its high Attack alongside an obscenely powerful STAB- and Strong Jaw-boosted Psychic Fangs allows Bruxish to perfectly complement its access to Swords Dance and decent Speed tier as a sweeper or wallbreaker on offensive teams. Alongside its powerful Psychic Fangs, Bruxish has access to useful STAB priority in the form of Aqua Jet as well as a powerful coverage option in Strong Jaw-boosted Crunch, which further bolsters its offensive presence. Unfortunately, said offensive presence is slightly offset by Bruxish's abysmal bulk, as it will often struggle to survive attacks from Pokemon that it fails to KO, which are quite common in the metagame. Bruxish's Speed, while good, can also hamper it at times, as it is still outsped and heavily threatened by common Pokemon such as Swellow, Flygon, and Shaymin. Bruxish also struggles from four-moveslot syndrome in that it often has to decide between running Crunch or Waterfall, meaning that it will always struggle to break through a certain foe. Lastly, choosing Bruxish's nature can also be a struggle, as Bruxish will slightly lack power with a Jolly nature and be slightly slow with an Adamant nature.", "Illumise": "Illumise is completely outclassed as a weather setter by Volbeat. Illumise and Volbeat share the same utility movepool and defensive stats, but Illumise has a weaker U-turn due to its lower Attack stat.", "Registeel": "Registeel's bulk lets it easily wall and check many specially offensive Pokemon in the tier like Comfey, Swellow, Diancie, Roserade, and Dragalge while serving as a blanket check to many Pokemon that can only hit it neutrally, especially with special attacks. This, in tandem with access to helpful utility moves such as Stealth Rock, also allows it to be a very consistent entry hazard setter. Registeel can also cripple opposing Pokemon with status without ever being overly passive, as it can stall with Protect and Toxic and deal solid damage with Seismic Toss. On the other hand, its typing means that it is weak to the ever-common Ground-, Fire-, and Fighting-types, specifically being pressured by Salazzle, Flygon, Zygarde-10%, and Pangoro with their super effective STAB moves and common coverage moves such as Focus Blast and Earthquake. In addition, it is susceptible to Taunt, which makes it susceptible to Pokemon like Noivern and Mismagius.", "Xatu": "Xatu is the embodiment of Magic Bounce; it is able to keep its team safe from entry hazards and take on the likes of Steelix, Ferroseed, and Miltank outstandingly. In a tier where several top-tier Pokemon are weak to Stealth Rock, the role Xatu provides is extremely valuable, supporting Pokemon like Incineroar and Mega Glalie. Access to Roost, U-turn, and a bunch of utility options let Xatu excel at the pivoting role it's known for, and its typing stands out in giving it a 4x resistance to Fighting-type moves. Another valuable trait is Xatu's solid matchup against stall teams, being able to bounce back status moves like Toxic to targets like Pyukumuku. That being said, hazard setters like Rhydon, Palossand, and Piloswine can threaten it out with their STAB moves, making it necessary to win mind games against them just to keep hazards away. Xatu is also prone to getting trapped by Sneasel and Houndoom, which could make it tough for Xatu's team to fight against hazards. Mold Breaker ignores Xatu's Magic Bounce, allowing Druddigon to set up Stealth Rock against teams that use Xatu as hazard control. Lastly, Xatu's bulk can be rather underwhelming, meaning players have to be very cautious to let it get worn down too fast. Likewise, its typing leaves it vulnerable to common Rock-, Electric-, and Ice-types.", "Scraggy": "Scraggy's unique Dark / Fighting typing gives it access to dual STAB coverage that hits a huge chunk of the LC metagame at least neutrally, which coupled with its fairly high Attack stat turns it into a threatening offensive Pokemon. Scraggy most often opts for a sweeper set, first using Dragon Dance to boost its Attack and patch up its mediocre Speed and then attempting to sweep opposing teams with its STAB attacks and variety of coverage moves. Alternatively, Scraggy can also become a threatening cleaner by using a Choice Scarf. Access to useful STAB moves helps Scraggy take advantage of the coverage that its typing gives it, especially Knock Off, Drain Punch, and High Jump Kick. Scraggy also can use two distinct abilities, both of which assist it in different ways. Moxie makes Scraggy more difficult to beat every time it KOes a foe, while Shed Skin gives it a way to shrug off status and more easily set up on status inducers. However, Scraggy suffers significantly from weaknesses to the common Fairy-, Flying-, and Fighting-types, which leave it often struggling to set up, despite its good defensive stats. Fairy-type Pokemon are especially troublesome, as they resist both of Scraggy's STAB moves. Additionally, though it has access to a wide variety of coverage moves, Scraggy must choose which to use, which means that depending on its set Scraggy can be walled by different Pokemon.", "Brionne": null, "Poochyena": "Poochyena is a mediocre Pokemon. Even with boosts, Poochyena cannot do any damage, is very slow, is easily revenge killed due to its poor bulk, and has a poor movepool to boot. Being heavily outclassed by Vullaby and Pawniard as a Dark-type is not doing Poochyena any favors as well. Since it lacks much offensive and defensive utility, Poochyena should never be used on a serious team.", "Silvally": "While Silvally's decent Attack in tandem with its access to Swords Dance and decently powerful STAB moves make it seem threatening, there isn't much reason to use it over other Normal-types. Stoutland and Kangaskhan more easily and consistently threaten balance and offense, respectively, due to their better coverage in moves like Superpower and Earthquake, their access to Scrappy, and the latter even possessing priority in Fake Out. Although they are frailer than it, Dodrio, Zangoose, and Alolan Raticate also outclass Silvally as Normal-type setup sweepers because of their secondary typings, their actually useful abilities, their more immediate power, their access to priority moves, and the former two's better Speed tiers.", "Azelf": "Azelf sits in a nigh-unmatched Speed tier, which, alongside its access to great utility options like Stealth Rock, Knock Off, and Taunt, allows it to excel on hyper offensive teams as an extremely reliable suicide lead. Azelf also possesses fantastic offensive stats and can capitalize on its access to powerful moves like Explosion and Fire Blast to wear opposing teams down before fainting. Unfortunately, Azelf's defenses are among the worst in the tier, which keeps it from taking advantage of its good offenses outside of its role as a suicide lead. This also makes Azelf extremely predictable, which can allow common Pokemon in Mega Aerodactyl, Scizor, and Choice Scarf Infernape to be used as adequate countermeasures. Azelf is also hurt by the prevalence of entry hazard removal in the tier, which can prevent it from keeping Stealth Rock up and, due to its frailty, setting it more than once.", "Virizion": "A great Speed stat allows Virizion to perform as a strong setup sweeper in the RU metagame, especially with Continental Crush giving it very good coverage. In addition to its offensive capabilities, Virizion's defensive typing, along with its incredible Special Defense stat, allows it to check threats in the RU metagame such as Donphan, Gigalith, Jolteon, Kingdra, and Galvantula. Despite this, however, Virizion is relatively weak without a boost and tends to rely on its Z-Move in order to inflict great damage, meaning it can get checked by bulky threats such as Cresselia, Necrozma, Dhelmise, and Acrobatics Gligar after using its Z-Move. It also has poor physical bulk that leaves it pressured by physical threats in the metagame such as Flygon. Finally, its Speed, while great, still allows Virizion to get revenge killed by the likes of Durant, Swellow, and Salazzle.", "Floette": null, "Shuckle": "Shuckle's great bulk and access to Stealth Rock give it a niche over other Sticky Web setters. The rest of its movepool furthers this, with good support moves such as Encore, Knock Off, and Infestation. Shuckle's amazing base 230 defenses and tolerable Bug / Rock typing give it a good amount of longevity, allowing it to more easily set up entry hazards and not always serve simply as a suicide lead. It also lets Shuckle perform well on both hyper and bulky offensive teams. However, the rest of its stats are utterly atrocious, with absolutely no offensive presence, the lowest base Speed in the game, and a low HP stat that its defenses do not appreciate. Furthermore, it faces a good amount of competition from other Sticky Web setters, such as Smeargle and Leavanny. On top of their much higher Speed stats, Smeargle has a better support movepool with access to moves such as Spore and Taunt to give it an easier matchup against slower foes and Nuzzle to cripple faster foes. Leavanny provides an offensive presence that threatens entry hazard removers such as Skuntank and has support moves of its own such as Magic Coat, which helps against opposing leads and Taunt users. Despite this, Shuckle maintains its niche with its much better bulk, which allows it to set both hazards more reliably than Smeargle, and its access to Stealth Rock, unlike Leavanny, which allows it to also pressure bulkier teams that do not mind Sticky Web. Shuckle's bulk and access to Sturdy also allow it to hold a Mental Herb, although the item can only be used once. However, this makes it less reliant on predictions through moves such as Spore and Magic Coat to get up hazards against Taunt users like Pyroar and Alolan Persian.", "Kakuna": null, "Seaking": "Besides its average Attack stat, Seaking's stats are mediocre, making it very easy to outspeed and KO. Even with its unique ability for a Water-type in Lightning Rod, Seaking finds itself outclassed by Lanturn. Lanturn has higher overall bulk, a secondary typing, and access to Volt Switch. Furthermore, Seaking is also outclassed by other physical Water-types such as Floatzel, Kabutops, and Carracosta with their higher offensive presence, ability to set up, overall versatility, the first two's higher Speed, the last two's secondary typing, and Carracosta's better bulk.", "Electrike": "Despite being able to viably run a Choice Scarf, Electrike is wholly outclassed in Little Cup due to its mediocre stats and average movepool by Magnemite, Chinchou, and Elekid, with the former two having secondary STAB options. While Electrike possesses Switcheroo, a useful utility option that can cripple bulky Pokemon such as Foongus, it isn't enough to warrant using Electrike on any competitive team.", "Minior": "Despite Minior's appeal as a Shell Smash sweeper with a useful ability to aid it with setting up, it falls short of more reliable setup sweepers like Comfey, Braviary, and Delphox due to its lacking stats in Meteor forme and poor defensive typing, which limit its ability to force opposing Pokemon out to safely set up. Minior also struggles to reliably beat bulky Water- and Ground-types like Vaporeon, Steelix, and Rhydon even with a Shell Smash boost.", "Torterra": "Torterra's combination of Grass / Ground typing, resistance to Ground-type moves, and solid defenses lets it reliably take on common Stealth Rock users such as Steelix, Palossand, and Rhydon as well as prominent offensive threats such as Passimian, Heliolisk, and Whimsicott. Torterra's access to Synthesis sets it apart from most other Stealth Rock users by making it more self-sufficient, and its high base Attack stat and access to strong STAB Grass- and Ground-type moves in Wood Hammer and Earthquake prevent it from being passive and letting Grass- and Ground-resistant Pokemon such as Decidueye, Braviary, and Sceptile easily switch in. Access to Swords Dance and Rock Polish combined with near perfect type coverage allows Torterra to become a threatening wallbreaker as well, easily dispatching common physical walls like Slowking, Steelix, and Garbodor. Unfortunately, Torterra's unimpressive Speed stat and weaknesses to prevalent typings leaves it easily revenge killed by common Pokemon like Sneasel, Braviary, Vivillon, and Magmortar. Additionally, Torterra is not only a Grass-type that cannot reliably switch into Scald by virtue of its Ground typing, but also one that is severely crippled by a potential burn or Toxic, making it a less effective check to common defensive Water-type Pokemon like Blastoise and Vaporeon.", "Morelull": "With very good defensive stats, a passable Special Attack stat, and a cool signature move in Strength Sap, Morelull can make for a relatively good defensive pivot. Spore and Moonblast add to this by putting switch-ins to sleep and catching incoming Fighting-types, respectively, as does its ability, Effect Spore. However, Morelull is commonly outclassed by the many other bulky Grass-types such as Ferroseed, Lileep, and most of all, Foongus, which also acts as a defensive pivot with Spore but has access to Regenerator. With the rise of Poison-types in SM, Morelull struggles to find a teamslot over Foongus due to its 4x weakness to the type, but its Fairy typing and slightly wider support movepool can certainly grant it a niche. It also struggles with a relatively passive playstyle in a very offensive metagame, making it unwelcome on many teams.", "Bounsweet": "With its abysmal stats, Bounsweet is a horrible pick for a Grass-type in the Little Cup metagame. It's outclassed by Snivy as an entry hazard remover and fails at anything else it attempts to do. Please do not use Bounsweet in Little Cup or elsewhere, as it will be a waste of a teamslot.", "Crabominable": "Crabominable boasts one of the highest Attack stats in the tier, which in tandem with its solid offensive typing, Iron Fist ability, and access to high-powered STAB moves in Close Combat and Ice Hammer gives it the ability to 2HKO a vast majority of the tier. Because of its low Speed, Crabominable fits perfectly on Trick Room teams as a hard-hitting physical wallbreaker. Due to how hard it hits under Trick Room, revenge killing it becomes rather difficult even for teams with priority moves. Crabominable can also function as an effective Assault Vest user, due to its solid bulk, coveted resistance to Ice, and decent damage output even without investment. However, Crabominable is pressured easily by common offensive Pokemon such as Stoutland as a result of its aforementioned low Speed, awkward defensive typing, and only decent bulk. While amazing offensively, Crabominable's typing isn't very good defensively outside of checking very specific Pokemon such as Aurorus, burdening it with weaknesses to common attacking types in Fire, Fighting, Flying, and Psychic. Crabominable faces stiff competition from other Fighting-types in the tier such as Gurdurr and Primeape and is forced to find its niche through Assault Vest or Trick Room sets rather than traditional offensive sets.", "Clawitzer": "Possessing a high Special Attack stat in combination with a great ability in Mega Launcher, Clawitzer is able to hit extremely hard. Its access to coverage moves in Dark Pulse and Aura Sphere solidifies Clawitzer's role as a wallbreaker, letting it hit a huge portion of the metagame for great damage. Clawitzer also has access to a slow U-turn and forces a lot of switches, allowing it to safely bring in teammates. However, Clawitzer is held back by the abundance of excellent Grass-types in the tier such as Whimsicott, Decidueye, and Sceptile. Moreover, its low Speed stat leaves it vulnerable to most faster powerful attackers in the tier, especially because its bulk is rather average. Clawitzer also faces competition from other Water-types in Samurott and Blastoise, which both sport a better Speed tier, outspeeding Pokemon like Omastar. Samurott also can bluff physical sets and pull off a mixed set, while Blastoise provides immense team support thanks to Rapid Spin and Refresh.", "Cyndaquil": "On paper, Cyndaquil's access to Eruption should make it a formidable sweeper; in practice, Cyndaquil's mediocre Special Attack and movepool leave it checked fairly easily. In addition, due to Cyndaquil's average Speed for an offensive Pokemon, it is forced to use a Choice Scarf set to be effective. Eruption allows Cyndaquil to make up for its relatively low Special Attack, but Cyndaquil's weakness to Stealth Rock and low bulk make it hard to keep Eruption's power up, and Eruption is Cyndaquil's only way to deal meaningful damage. Generally speaking, Ponyta and Larvesta are better options for offensive Fire-types, and even Houndour is a better choice as a Fire-type special attacker due to having much better Special Attack and a more useful movepool.", "Rotom-Heat": "Rotom-H's unique Fire / Electric typing provides key resistances to common offensive typings, such as Electric, Fire, Flying, Fairy, and Steel, allowing it to check Togekiss, Scizor, Mamoswine, and Mega Manectric all at once. When combined with its ability and access to Defog, this makes Rotom-H effective at role compression. With Defog, Rotom-H functions as an effective means of entry hazard removal and is able to threaten common hazard setters such as Klefki, Mega Aggron, and Hippowdon with Overheat and Toxic. Rotom-H's Speed tier allows it to outspeed important Pokemon in the tier like Mamoswine and Togekiss and just barely outspeed Nidoking, but it is slower than Pokemon such as Tentacruel and Moltres. Rotom-H also has a hard time removing hazards against setters such as Nihilego and Swampert, but Swampert does not like to be badly poisoned. It's often hard for Rotom-H to perform all of its roles effectively, as it is used to check many popular Pokemon in the metagame and has no reliable recovery, which causes it to be worn down easily. Rotom-H is also easily set up on by Dragon-types such as Kommo-o and Latias, as they resist its STAB moves; they do have to be wary of status conditions on the switch, though.", "Malamar": "Malamar's ability Contrary in combination with its access to Superpower makes it a threatening setup sweeper and allows it to increase both its Attack and Defense, augmenting its offensive and defensive presence. Malamar also has solid bulk when invested and a decent defensive typing, meaning that it can effectively run a RestTalk set that pressures balance teams and capitalizes on defensive staples like Vileplume and Steelix while also shrugging off status conditions. Because of its access to Happy Hour, Malamar is also capable of running a more offensive set with Z-Happy Hour, which increases all of Malamar's stats by one stage and gives it an easier time sweeping teams late-game. Offensive and defensive teams alike can find dealing with Malamar difficult due to its near unresisted coverage in Knock Off + Superpower. However, Malamar's all-around average stats leave it fairly weak unboosted and can make setting up difficult, especially against more offensive teams. Malamar's typing also leaves it vulnerable two common attacking types in Bug and Fairy and provides Malamar with no useful resistances or immunities except Psychic. Fairy-types also resist Malamar's main coverage, which gives Malamar further difficulty in dealing with them.", "Staravia": null, "Entei": "Entei is a powerful wallbreaker that can plow through common defensive measures while still being capable of cleaning up against offensive teams when they are weakened enough. In a tier where Infernape, which is unpredictable and has a secondary Fighting typing and U-turn to limit counterplay, and Darmanitan, with access to Sheer Force to break through walls Entei could not otherwise such as Suicune and Mega Latias, roam free, Entei may appear underwhelming. However, it sets itself apart through its access to Sacred Fire, a powerful STAB move with no recoil and a 50% chance to burn a foe, and Extreme Speed, a more powerful and higher priority move than anything the competition can muster. However, due to its pure Fire typing, Entei is vulnerable to all forms of entry hazards, losing a quarter of its health to Stealth Rock alone. Additionally, due to Extreme Speed being event exclusive and forcing Entei to run an Adamant nature, its Speed leaves something to be desired as well, failing to outspeed offensive threats such as Krookodile, Venomoth, and Hydreigon. On top of that, it has a very shallow movepool, leaving it with only one viable set to run.", "Prinplup": null, "Beheeyem": "Beheeyem possesses a huge base Special Attack stat, making it a powerful wallbreaker. This is further augmented by Analytic boosting the power of Beheeyem's attacks when it moves last. Due to its access to both Trick Room and Nasty Plot, Beheeyem can effectively function versus offensive and defensive teams alike. This is furthered by Beheeyem's incredibly low Speed stat of 40, which allows it to outspeed virtually the entire tier under Trick Room and take full advantage of Analytic when outside of Trick Room. However, only passable bulk in addition to its terrible Speed stat mean that Beheeyem finds few opportunities to set up and is easily forced out by many offensive threats. This is further exacerbated by a poor defensive typing in Psychic, which bestows few useful resistances outside of Fighting. Psychic also isn't a great offensive typing to have in a tier rife with powerful Dark-types such as Skuntank and Spiritomb and their STAB Sucker Punch. Compounding these issues, Beheeyem struggles to make room for Recover, leaving it easily worn down throughout the match and vulnerable to priority. Beheeyem also faces heavy competition from Mesprit and Musharna outside of Trick Room, with Mesprit having a much better speed tier and more versatile movepool, while Musharna has much better bulk and makes for a more potent slow setup sweeper. Lastly, Beheeyem faces competition as a dedicated Trick Room special sweeper from Pokemon with better offensive and defensive typings such as Wishiwashi, which hits harder with better bulk, and Alolan Exeggutor, which also has better coverage and access to Trick Room.", "Dunsparce": "Despite having a decent HP stat, all of Dunsparce's other stats are so low that it isn't viable in PU, especially since it has very poor Speed and no way to boost it. Apart from that, it is outclassed as a bulky Pokemon by Audino and Type: Null thanks to their better defensive attributes, and as an offensive Pokemon, Kangaskhan and Stoutland are able to deal much more damage while having better abilities as well. Instead, Dunsparce has to rely on luck to annoy its foe and is much more passive than its Normal-type counterparts.", "Murkrow": null, "Braixen": null, "Spewpa": null, "Dusclops": null, "Ariados": "Despite its access to both Sticky Web and Toxic Spikes, Ariados is an abysmal lead for multiple reasons. Its low Speed leaves it very vulnerable to Taunt users, notably Froslass and Qwilfish, two far better leads, as well as a slew of offensive Pokemon. To make this issue worse, the prevalence of Skuntank, Qwilfish, and Roselia tends to limit the effectiveness of Toxic Spikes. Ariados's offensive presence is also rather lackluster, forcing it to rely on Swarm-boosted Megahorn for most of its damage output. Finally, it is simply grossly outclassed by other leads like Froslass, Qwilfish, and even Smeargle, with their higher Speed tiers and greater utility options and supportive capabilities making them easier to use and much more consistent.", "Foongus": "Thanks to its great defensive typing, Foongus makes for an excellent answer to many of the metagame's top threats, such as Timburr, Snivy, and Chinchou, being able to nullify them for the entire match thanks to its great longevity with Regenerator and Giga Drain. Once in play, Foongus can turn out to be quite a nuisance with its supportive movepool, which most notably contains Spore, and decent offensive presence. However, its only decent defensive stats leave it somewhat vulnerable to lures.", "Vullaby": "Vullaby is incredibly dominant and versatile in the LC metagame thanks to good stats, a wide movepool, and a fantastic typing, which allow it to perform many roles on a team. Offensively, Vullaby's typing gives it close to unresisted dual STAB moves, with the only LC Pokemon not hit at least neutrally by one of Vullaby's STAB moves being Pawniard. On top of this, Vullaby has access to powerful and useful moves in Brave Bird, Knock Off, Air Slash, and Dark Pulse to take advantage of this. It can also boost its stats with Nasty Plot and Weak Armor, allowing it to function as a potent sweeper.", "Tsareena": "Tsareena is unique because it's the only viable spinner in the RU metagame, boasting a strong STAB move in Power Whip as well as Knock Off, which helps punish Ghost-types, which can attempt to block Rapid Spin, while High Jump Kick rounds up its coverage to hit Pokemon such as Porygon2 and Umbreon super effectively. In addition, Queenly Majesty makes Tsareena immune to priority moves, letting it serve as an offensive check to Mega Abomasnow and Honchkrow if it uses High Jump Kick, as well as Decidueye and Linoone. Tsareena's Speed puts it above base 70s such as Honchkrow and Decidueye, but it's still slower than Feraligatr, Necrozma, and Nidoqueen, all of which can severely hurt Tsareena or KO it. Lastly, it competes with Roserade and Shaymin as an offensive Grass-type wallbreaker but has the niche of being a Rapid Spin user.", "Yanmega": "Thanks to Tinted Lens making Yanmega's STAB moves a lot more spammable, it can act as an fantastic Choice Specs wallbreaker against bulkier and slower teams. Yanmega also has access to Speed Boost, which makes it a solid sweeper against frailer offensive teams, which generally don't carry the means to properly deal with it defensively nor offensively. Yanmega's typing is pretty bad defensively, however, as it leaves Yanmega weak to common offensive Fire-, Ice-, Electric-, Rock-, and Flying-types like Salazzle, Mega Glalie, Raikou, Rhyperior, and Ninetales. Its typing also gives it a hefty weakness to Stealth Rock, which cuts away 50% of its health upon switching in.", "Simisage": "Simisage is an overall underwhelming Pokemon due to its barely above average offensive and terrible defensive stats. This leaves it outclassed by many other mixed Grass-types such as Shiftry and Abomasnow due to their secondary offensive typings alongside other niches such as both's STAB priority, Shiftry's hazard removal, and Abomasnow's solid coverage. Simisage's horrible defensive stats also leave Simisage extremely susceptible to faster foes such as Scyther, offensive Froslass, and Choice Scarf Swanna.", "Sunflora": "Sunflora is a hopeless Grass-type that aims to function on sun but falls on its face due to its awful Speed, unsalvageable even with Chlorophyll, and especially poor Defense. As a sun sweeper, Sunflora is outclassed entirely by Victreebel, which has far greater Speed, a Grass / Poison typing, better bulk, and access to Sleep Powder, all of which allow Victreebel to take advantage of Growth to become a far more effective sweeper in sun. Even as a slower wallbreaker focused on power, Alolan Exeggutor does its job far better due to sporting an additional Dragon typing, stronger STAB attacks, more coverage, notably better bulk, and no reliance on sun.", "Silcoon": null, "Porygon-Z": "While it's true that after Z-Conversion Porygon-Z becomes a threatening sweeper, its overreliance on stat boosts from the aforementioned move, inability to get a second chance at sweeping, and reliance on a lot of support hold it back from being viable in the metagame. Furthermore, Porygon-Z's low stats, except Special Attack, mean that it's hard to find setup opportunities due to low defenses and lack of resistances, so Porygon-Z is outclassed by better setup sweepers like Magearna. Even after setup, Porygon-Z is still relatively easy to revenge kill with common forces like Choice Scarf Landorus-T and Ash-Greninja because Porygon-Z doesn't have priority to hit these revenge killers.", "Lombre": null, "Volcarona": "Volcarona is one of the deadliest sweepers in the tier because of its access to Quiver Dance, high Special Attack stat, and decent Speed stat. Its large movepool, which is complemented by Z-Moves, allows Volcarona to pick its checks and counters. Volcarona also has a ton of setup opportunities in a tier infested with Steel-types and passive Pokemon such as Tangrowth. However, Volcarona is held back by its 4x weakness to Stealth Rock, requiring Defog or Rapid Spin support. Volcarona will also lose to a common Pokemon depending on its set, meaning it can be inconsistent. Finally, Volcarona often cannot sweep in practice, since it will be forced out by Choice Scarf users above its Speed tier such as Greninja as well as strong priority users such as Ash-Greninja and Mega Pinsir.", "Roserade": "Powerful STAB moves, potent coverage, and high versatility make Roserade RU's premier Spiker. Said versatility gives Roserade the means to potentially beat almost any entry hazard remover, including the best spinner in Mega Blastoise, and its offensive prowess forces many switches that further ease setting Spikes. Sludge Bomb and Technician-boosted Hidden Power can cover almost anything that could hope to take Leaf Storm, including Flying-types, Fire-types, and Steel-types; this makes Roserade a problem for frail, offensive teams and slow, bulky teams alike. A Grass / Poison typing gives Roserade the resistances to switch into Water-types and check a fair number of foes in a pinch as well. With Hidden Power Fire, Sleep Powder, and multiple items to choose from, Roserade can be tough to predict and consistently switch into. However, relative frailty keeps Roserade from switching in on many foes that aren't passive or Water type, and even then, it needs Synthesis to consistently answer Water-types. Poor bulk also makes Roserade easy to pick off or revenge kill, and though its Speed is decent, it falls short of major threats such as Ninetales. Roserade experiences moveslot issues, as it wants both Sludge Bomb and Hidden Power to hit as many foes as possible and Synthesis to stick around longer, not to mention Sleep Powder, but can only fit two of these moves. It faces some competition from fellow Grass-types Shaymin and Virizion, which boast a Ground resistance as well as greater Speed and bulk. Unique access to Spikes and Technician Hidden Power keeps Roserade relevant, though.", "Corsola": "Corsola's stats make it extremely passive, slow, and a momentum sink, and its defensive typing is also quite bad, since there are a lot of top threats such as Lilligant and Gurdurr that have a type advantage against it. It is outclassed by multiple Stealth Rock users, most notably Omastar, which shares a similar typing to Corsola, Regirock, and Clefairy, which all have better stats and are more threatening. The only redeeming quality that Corsola has is possessing two types of recovery in Recover and Regenerator.", "Loudred": null, "Frillish": "Frillish's access to Water Spout and Trick enables it to utilize a Choice Scarf to either deal significant damage before taking a hit or cripple a defensive switch-in. Furthermore, great coverage in Ice Beam and Energy Ball allows Frillish to surprise its checks and counters. Frillish is also able to spinblock and can counter the most common spinner in LC, Staryu. It can use Will-O-Wisp to cripple physical attackers and Recover to stay healthy throughout the match so it can keep spinblocking. However, Knock Off's prevalence in LC makes it harder for Frillish to check certain Pokemon, especially Fighting-types, which usually carry this move. Additionally, Dark-types such as Vullaby and Scraggy are able to set up on Frillish. It also faces competition from Pumpkaboo-XL as a spinblocker and Staryu as a fast offensive Water-type; however, Scald gives Frillish a niche over the former, and Water Spout gives it a niche over the latter.", "Kadabra": "Kadabra is an excellent revenge killer in the PU tier. In contrast to other Psychic-types such as Mesprit and Musharna that offer good defensive utility, Kadabra's main niche comes with its unique ability to check many offensive threats with Magic Guard and Counter. Kadabra's Focus Sash cannot be broken by residual damage due to its ability, which makes it very reliable at revenge killing. Its base 105 Speed tier is decent in PU, as it lets Kadabra outspeed Pokemon like Jynx, Swanna, and the Silvally formes, but it isn't amazing either, as Kadabra can also be outsped by important threats such as Liepard and Lycanroc. Kadabra's main drawback comes from its terrible defensive stats, meaning it cannot switch into any type of attack; this makes Kadabra hard to fit on any archetype other than hyper offense.", "Purugly": "Even if Purugly looks like a wise choice due to its decent Attack, nice Speed, great movepool, and good ability, it faces heavy competition from other stronger Normal-types, especially from Kangaskhan, which also has access to Fake Out and Sucker Punch, but also from Stoutland and Alolan-Raticate, which sport better abilities. Purugly also suffers from pitiful bulk, leaving it susceptible to faster threats like Floatzel and priority users like Gurdurr. It sadly fails to dent bulkier Pokemon such as Jellicent and Alolan Sandslash due to its underwhelming firepower. It doesn't help that Purugly can't do much to Rock-types like Regirock and Aggron, unlike its competition.", "Uxie": "Although Uxie is mostly overlooked in favor of its bulkier Psychic-type cousin Cresselia, it can act as a useful pivot and Stealth Rock user, which is enough to earn a niche. Its enormous supportive movepool, which features Yawn, U-turn, Memento, Knock Off, and Thunder Wave, makes it a very versatile Pokemon that can freely choose moves and EV spreads to accommodate its team's weaknesses. A high Speed stat for a defensive Pokemon allows it to potentially outspeed several threats to beat them with ease, such as Toxicroak, Roserade, and Nidoqueen. Uxie fits on offensive and bulky offensive teams that need a Fighting- and Poison-type counter that can avoid passivity issues, unlike Cresselia. Its ability to facilitate setup from the likes of Barbaracle and Linoone also makes it a great pick on these archetypes. Its great ability in Levitate can let it switch into dangerous Ground-types like Flygon, Torterra, and Nidoqueen and hit them with an attack, put them to sleep, or set up Stealth Rock in their faces. It also has a great matchup against opposing offensive teams, as it is able to quickly disrupt their momentum with Yawn and U-turn. However, despite having Yawn and U-turn to combat its passivity, Uxie's mediocre and uninvested Special Attack means its attacks are still very weak, which is an issue against Pokemon that don't mind being put to sleep, like Snorlax and Calm Mind Cresselia. Although base 130 / 130 defenses are amazing, they are let down by its slightly mediocre HP stat. This makes it more vulnerable to moves such as Pursuit compared to Cresselia. Most importantly, however, despite its extensive movepool, Uxie has no way to reliably recover its HP. This makes it very hard to consistently check the threats it's supposed to throughout the entire match. Although Wiki Berry slightly alleviates this, it makes Uxie much more inconsistent on bulkier teams, where Cresselia is preferred and its passivity can be accommodated.", "Beedrill": "By virtue of amazing offensive stats and Adaptability, Mega Beedrill is among the best offensive pivots available. Its typing allows it to provide heavy offensive pressure to common Pokemon such as Primarina and Latias, while its access to good coverage options like Drill Run and Knock Off lets it hit the majority of the tier quite hard. Mega Beedrill also has access to Toxic Spikes, which it can use as it forces switches to wear down opposing Pokemon. However, Mega Beedrill has atrocious bulk, which leaves it vulnerable to Choice Scarf users, strong priority, and the ever-present Mega Aerodactyl. Its Stealth Rock-weak typing also keeps it from properly functioning as a pivot without an entry hazard remover on its team, thus complicating building with Mega Beedrill at times. Lastly, Mega Beedrill struggles to break past a few big presences in the tier, including Hippowdon, Scizor, and Mega Aerodactyl, due to its only decent coverage.", "Regirock": "Regirock's immense physical bulk and useful resistances to Normal-, Fire-, Flying-, and Poison-type attacks from common Pokemon such as Kangaskhan, Pyroar, and Skuntank allow it many opportunities to cripple foes with Toxic or support its teammates by setting up Stealth Rock. Furthermore, given its access to Sunny Day and a useful ability in Sturdy that allows it to set up the move consistently, Regirock is adept in providing support to weather-based sweepers that are dependent on Chlorophyll being activated, making it an essential component of Sunny Day-based teams. Regirock is not without fault, however: its low Speed stat and weakness to ubiquitous Water-, Ground-, Grass-, and Fighting-type coverage moves leave it easily checked by offensive Pokemon like Floatzel, Golurk, Shiftry, and Hitmonchan. Additionally, its inherently passive nature as a defensive Stealth Rock setter means that it can be overly reliant on Toxic to deal significant damage to Pokemon that have a type advantage over Regirock like Gastrodon. Regirock's lack of reliable recovery and vulnerability to entry hazards are detrimental to its longevity, which can in turn disallow Regirock to switch into the Pokemon that it is meant to check. Nevertheless, Regirock still holds a niche as one of the best Stealth Rock setters in the tier due to its excellent bulk and pure Rock typing.", "Drifblim": "Drifblim's niche in the PU metagame lies with its ability Unburden, which allows it to outspeed almost the entire metagame after activating its item, including all Choice Scarf users slower than Choice Scarf Dodrio. This makes Drifblim a unique choice for a sweeper. Drifblim has a solid STAB attack in Acrobatics, and many of the common switch-ins to Acrobatics are bothered by Will-O-Wisp and Hex, making Drifblim an effective support Pokemon as well. Unfortunately, while Drifblim's typing gives it key immunities, it also leaves it with very exploitable weaknesses to common Pokemon like Froslass, Lycanroc, and Skuntank. Drifblim's mediocre offensive stats mean it can often lack power and is fairly useless before activating its Berry, and it struggles to break through common Pokemon like Alolan Persian, Mudsdale, and Oricorio-E even after the Unburden boost. It also faces competition with other Flying-type attackers, such as Dodrio and Oricorio-G, which have more immediate offensive capabilities.", "Hitmonlee": "Hitmonlee is an interesting, albeit very flawed, setup sweeper in NeverUsed. Its appeal comes from access to both Curse and the ability Unburden, which, after consuming a White Herb, makes Hitmonlee the fastest non-Choice Scarf Pokemon in the tier. However, despite a naturally high Attack stat, Hitmonlee has trouble breaking through typical Fighting-type answers such as Garbodor, Vileplume, and especially Weezing. Furthermore, Hitmonlee only gets one chance to sweep, and if it loses its White Herb before it sets up, it is potentially dead weight, limiting it to being a late-game sweeper. If it doesn't set up, Hitmonlee's middling Speed and poor bulk mean it is easily revenge killed by faster Pokemon such as Whimsicott, Choice Scarf Passimian, and Delphox. This is why Hitmonlee finds itself outclassed as a Fighting-type by Passimian and Medicham.", "Gorebyss": "With access to Shell Smash, Gorebyss is able to serve as a decent setup sweeper and wallbreaker. Its nice base 114 Special Attack, powerful STAB move in Hydro Pump, and various coverage options such as Ice Beam, Hidden Power Grass, and Hidden Power Fire all help Gorebyss in performing its roles. However, its low Speed largely hinders Gorebyss, making it much easier for Choice Scarf users such as Primeape and Togedemaru to revenge kill it, even after a Shell Smash. If Gorebyss has taken enough damage, it can also be revenge killed by priority users such as Skuntank, Kangaskhan, and Hitmonchan. This leads to large competition from Carracosta, which has priority in Aqua Jet to make up for its low Speed, better bulk, Solid Rock, a secondary STAB move in Stone Edge, and the ability to run a mixed set, making it even harder to stop after it sets up a Shell Smash. Despite this, Gorebyss can carve itself a niche thanks to its higher Special Attack and Speed that allow it to not get stopped by certain threats to Carracosta such as Taunt Weezing. Gorebyss also faces some competition from other offensive Water-types in general, such as Floatzel and Swanna, due to their higher base Speed stats as well as Swanna's additional utility in its access to Defog and resistance to Fighting-type attacks, often allowing them to support their team better throughout the game.", "Mimikyu": "Mimikyu holds a niche in the OU metagame due to its unique typing and ability Disguise, which gives it a free turn to attack or set up. Defensively, Mimikyu can act as a blanket check to many threats such as Volcarona and Mega Medicham. Ghost- and Fairy-type STAB moves allow Mimikyu to hit the entire metagame for at least neutral damage. Decent Attack along with access to Swords Dance and great STAB coverage allows Mimikyu to clean easily. However, Mimikyu struggles to break common defensive Pokemon such Toxapex and Landorus-T. Also, once Disguise is broken, Mimikyu is very easy to revenge kill, as it is very frail and isn't very fast.", "Lampent": null, "Cacturne": "Cacturne finds its niche in the PU metagame as a strong offensive Spikes setter. High base offensive stats allow Cacturne to wallbreak, and Water Absorb and Cacturne's ability to use Spikes are the main features that set it apart from Shiftry, which would mostly outclass it otherwise. Water Absorb notably allows Cacturne to come in on passive Water-type Pokemon such as Gastrodon and Lanturn without fearing Scald burns. Also, Cacturne's offensive typing allows it to threaten a lot of opposing Stealth Rock setters such as Regirock, Mesprit, and Bronzor. However, its subpar defensive stats make Cacturne very vulnerable to any type of super effective hit or any strong attack in general. Cacturne also has an awful base 55 Speed tier, meaning it is outsped by a lot of offensive Pokemon like Aurorus and Abomasnow; this also means it is very reliant on Sucker Punch to hit faster threats. Its inability to hit Skuntank for a lot of damage can also hinder its ability to effectively wallbreak and set up Spikes.", "Raichu": "The main reason to not use Raichu is the fact that it is completely outclassed by its brother, Alolan Raichu. This is due to Alolan Raichu's secondary typing that allows it to hit Pokemon like Roselia and Clefairy much harder and resist Mach Punch. While Raichu's lack of a secondary typing may seem to give it a better matchup against Sucker Punch and Pursuit users like Skuntank, its poor defensive stats lead to Raichu still taking a lot from both.", "Musharna": "Musharna is a decent Pokemon in the tier, as it has solid bulk combined with reliable recovery thanks to Moonlight, which makes it a solid response to Fighting-types such as Hitmonchan and Gurdurr as well as other physical attackers such as Kangaskhan and Floatzel. It does face competition from Mesprit as a Psychic-type, though, due to Mesprit being faster and having more coverage options at its disposal, but Musharna sets itself apart from Mesprit thanks to its higher bulk allowing it to pull off a Calm Mind set more effectively and its access to reliable recovery, which Mesprit lacks, making it a solid wincon in most situations. Musharna's low Speed forces it to take a hit before retaliating, and it can be easily worn down through the means of status as well as entry hazards while also being susceptible to Taunt from Pokemon like Oricorio-G, which prevents Musharna from using Moonlight. It can also be overwhelmed by hard-hitting Pokemon such as Zangoose and Aurorus, which can easily 2HKO Musharna with their STAB attacks.", "Emboar": "Despite Emboar's access to Reckless and high Attack stat, it finds itself outclassed by numerous other Fighting- and Fire-type wallbreakers in RU, such as Bewear, Toxicroak, Medicham, and Entei. Emboar's base 65 Speed stat and decent STAB combination mean it is able to outspeed and beat common Fighting- and Fire-type checks such as Cresselia, Florges, Mega Ampharos, Adamant Tyrantrum, Rhyperior, and Milotic. It still falls short of prominent Pokemon such as Jolly Barbaracle, Jolly Tyrantrum, and Gardevoir, though. While Reckless is a great offensive ability, it comes with the downside of wearing down Emboar extremely quickly. Coupled with its relatively low Speed, lackluster bulk, and vulnerability to entry hazards, this often means Emboar won't last long in drawn-out battles against bulkier teams, unlike other wallbreakers with recovery and better defensive presences like Bewear and Toxicroak. Emboar's secondary STAB attack in Superpower also has a drawback in lowering its Attack and Defense stats; the opponent can take advantage of this to force Emboar out or set up on it, which further compounds its vulnerability to entry hazards. Its decent defensive typing allows it to check Pokemon like Escavalier and Honchkrow, although it offers very little defensive presence compared to Bewear, Toxicroak, or Arcanine. While it does have access to priority, Sucker Punch is not very reliable due to how punishable a misplay with it can be. This is further augmented if Emboar is running a Choice Band set.", "Noivern": "Noivern's fantastic Speed tier, access to Taunt and Roost, and decent bulk allow it to act as an effective revenge killer and stallbreaker. Noivern's Speed in particular allows it to outpace the majority of unboosted Pokemon in RarelyUsed, including threats like Virizion and Salazzle. The defensive perks of Noivern's Dragon / Flying typing, notably resistances to Fighting-, Fire-, Bug-, and Grass-type moves, let it act as a workable switch-in to common offensive Pokemon, such as Virizion, Arcanine, Golisopod, and Roserade, and force prediction from stronger wallbreakers like Flame Orb Machamp. Noivern has a fully customizable fourth moveslot with options such as Super Fang, U-turn, Flamethrower, and Draco Meteor, which allows it to improve bad matchups. For example, if a wallbreaking teammate such as Choice Band Pangoro needs opportunities to break defensive cores, Noivern can opt for U-turn to give it free turns. Choice Scarf Noivern is one of the best revenge killers in the tier, able to handle extremely quick setup sweepers such as Shell Smash Barbaracle and Rock Polish Tyrantrum while still providing utility in U-turn and Switcheroo. However, Noivern's bulk, while great for an offensive Pokemon, only allows it to barely avoid KOs from attacks like Virizion's Stone Edge, so any residual damage from sources such as Toxic and Stealth Rock severely cuts into its ability to switch into threats.", "Blaziken": null, "Mismagius": "Mismagius's solid Special Attack and Speed alongside Nasty Plot, its coverage options, and Z-Crystals make it a notable sweeper capable of threatening specially defensive Pokemon like Incineroar, Assault Vest Slowking, and Cryogonal. Mismagius's potency is furthered by useful utility options in Taunt and Protect, which provide it with insurance against status moves as well as faster Choice item attackers like Heliolisk, Passimian, and Braviary. Unfortunately, Mismagius is extremely prone to being Pursuit trapped by faster attackers like Sneasel, Aerodactyl, and Choice Scarf Houndoom due to its lacking physical bulk and typing. Furthermore, because Mismagius's overall bulk is so poor, it struggles to find opportunities to set up Nasty Plot. Due to its moves being only average in power, Mismagius is heavily reliant on Nasty Plot and Z-Crystals to break many defensive Pokemon like Druddigon, Mega Audino, and Torterra, meaning it often struggles to apply consistent offensive pressure to bulkier builds.", "Rhydon": "Rhydon's Rock / Ground typing is accentuated by Eviolite and great physical bulk as well as very usable special bulk, letting it check many potent offensive threats such as Incineroar, Choice Scarf Rotom, and Braviary. High base 130 Attack combined with strong moves in Earthquake, Megahorn, and Stone Edge gives Rhydon the ability to pose a potent offensive threat to most teams and threaten common forms of entry hazard control such as Xatu, Silvally-Steel, and Cryogonal, making it a reliable Stealth Rock user. However, a lack of recovery leaves Rhydon easily worn down by enemy attacks and passive damage. This is compounded by its reliance on Eviolite, forcing it to be very wary of Knock Off users such as Incineroar. Furthermore, exploitable weaknesses to Grass, Water, and Ground mean that Rhydon is often at the mercy of the foe's coverage moves, such as Heliolisk's Surf, Comfey's Giga Drain, and Incineroar's Earthquake. These weaknesses also force Rhydon to play very carefully against Grass- and Water-types such as Sceptile and defensive Slowking.", "Poliwhirl": null, "Farfetch'd": "Farfetch'd is unsurprisingly an awful choice because its stats are pitiful and it's hopelessly outclassed by many other Flying-types in the tier. While it has some eye-catching quirks like First Impression, it often flops compared to other options for wallbreakers or priority users due to its unspectacular Speed tier and nearly complete lack of defensive utility making it easy to revenge kill. Dodrio and Scyther in particular sport Swords Dance as well and have much better Speed tiers. Farfetch'd also struggles to put a dent in Steel-types and Oricorio-E, despite its decent movepool otherwise.", "Komala": "Komala has a unique niche with its ability Comatose preventing it from being afflicted with status, allowing it to pivot into status moves with ease as well as giving it an immunity to Toxic Spikes. Access to Rapid Spin and the pivoting move U-turn is Komala's main niche as a Normal-type and is generally the only reason you would use it over Stoutland, Kangaskhan, and Zangoose, which have much better offensive presence, or Audino, which has much better bulk. With a base Attack stat of 115 and a wide range of coverage moves, Komala can hit most of the tier fairly hard. However, even with Komala's immunity to status moves, many Pokemon that carry them like Spiritomb, Gastrodon, and Weezing can beat it one-on-one. Komala also has a hard time beating spinblockers, as its main way of hitting Ghost-types is Sucker Punch which can easily be played around, giving the opponent opportunity to set up or get free switches. Its low physical bulk also leaves it vulnerable to strong physical attackers. Komala suffers from four-moveslot syndrome on almost any kind of set, having to pick and choose what Pokemon it wants to handle. It can run Play Rough to hit Spiritomb, Wood Hammer to hit Gastrodon, and a number of other coverage moves to hit its checks harder, but not all on one set. Komala also faces extreme competition from Assault Vest Hitmonchan, which checks many dangerous special attackers such as Aurorus far better than Komala.", "Vivillon": "The combination of its access to Quiver Dance, decent Speed and Special Attack, and good offensive typing makes Vivillon one of the deadliest setup sweepers in NU, capable of threatening offensive and defensive teams alike. Sleep Powder is another factor that contributes to how threatening Vivillon is, allowing it to incapacitate even its hardest checks in Pokemon like Steelix, Silvally-Steel, and Rhydon and proving useful in generating setup opportunities. Furthermore, Compound Eyes increasing the accuracy of Vivillon's moves makes Sleep Powder and Hurricane far more reliable than usual. Vivillon also boasts good coverage in Hurricane + Energy Ball, which is enough to hit the entire tier barring most Steel-types neutrally. However, Vivillon's defensive presence is rather poor due to its typing leaving it 4x weak to Stealth Rock and vulnerable to common attacking typings in Electric, Fire, Flying, and Ice and its low defenses preventing it from taking neutral attacks well even after using Quiver Dance and leaving it susceptible to priority from the likes of Sneasel and Medicham. Vivillon is weak unboosted, meaning that it will need to accrue a number of boosts in order to break through bulkier Pokemon like Assault Vest Slowking as well as balance teams.", "Comfey": "Comfey's great offensive typing in Fairy combined with Triage priority moves such as Draining Kiss and Giga Drain helps it revenge kill many offensive threats like Passimian, Sneasel, and Medicham. The combination of Calm Mind and good priority options also makes Comfey a threatening late-game sweeper. However, due to its lackluster physical bulk, Comfey often struggles to switch into even neutral physical moves. Its relatively weak moves also mean that Comfey has to rely on its ability to set up to break down opposing teams and that it generally struggles to break through the tier's common defensive walls such as Incineroar, Vileplume, and Torterra. It also has a hard time breaking the tier's Poison-types like Garbodor and Golbat.", "Ferrothorn": "Ferrothorn is a premier hazard setter in the OU tier, as it has access to both Spikes and Stealth Rock. They are very important in pressuring opposing teams as they switch Pokemon, which is why Ferrothorn is so successful. Ferrothorn can also annoy other teams with moves like Leech Seed and Knock Off, which whittle or cripple opposing Pokemon. Thanks to solid defenses and an excellent Grass / Steel typing that provides plenty of resistances, it finds many opportunities to set up entry hazards or fire off moves to annoy the opposing team. Ferrothorn is naturally a good check to Pokemon such as Tapu Koko, Kingdra, Ash-Greninja, and Mega Swampert, though it is easily worn down by the latter two. While Ferrothorn is a very good Pokemon, it is extremely slow, which hampers its offensive presence, since it will practically always be outsped. Fortunately, it has high-Base Power STAB moves, so it is not completely passive. Ferrothorn is also 4x weak to Fire, so it should be wary of Hidden Power Fire from Pokemon like Greninja, and it is easily forced out by Heatran and other Fire-types.", "Sunkern": null, "Milotic": "Milotic is the best bulky Water-type in the tier thanks to its solid bulk and access to Haze allowing it to wall a whole host of top threats, including Doublade, Feraligatr, Mega Glalie, and Snorlax. Milotic is also quite hard to take down thanks to Recover and Refresh keeping it healthy throughout the match. However, Milotic is somewhat passive, as its only damage output comes from uninvested Scald and potentially Toxic. Also, Milotic's bulk only goes so far; strong neutral physical hits such as Honchkrow's Brave Bird and Choice Band Zygarde-10%'s Outrage are capable of breaking through it.", "Aerodactyl": "Mega Aerodactyl is one of the most dominant offensive Pokemon in the UU metagame thanks to its combination of speed, power, and versatility, allowing it to fit on every team archetype. Its immense base 150 Speed makes it the fastest unboosted Pokemon in the tier. A sizable base 135 Attack coupled with Tough Claws and a wide arsenal of moves, such as Stone Edge, Earthquake, Ice Fang, and Pursuit, allows Mega Aerodactyl to hit a vast amount of Pokemon in the tier super effectively. Pursuit lets it trap common Pokemon, such as Latias, Gengar, and Celebi. However, even with its vast movepool, Mega Aerodactyl still does not possess the necessary firepower to break through some of UU's bulkier walls, such as Swampert and Mega Aggron. Mega Aerodactyl is also susceptible to Stealth Rock due to its part Flying typing and weak to the powerful priority moves that flood the UU metagame, such as Bullet Punch from Scizor and Ice Shard from Mamoswine, meaning that it can be worn down rather easily when not packing Roost. Lastly, Mega Aerodactyl is outsped by common Choice Scarf users such as Krookodile and Hydreigon, which can revenge kill it after Stealth Rock damage.", "Koffing": "A Poison typing with the complementing ability Levitate leaves Koffing with useful resistances and only one weakness. Its great Defense stat allows it to be a nuisance to common Fighting-types such as Mienfoo and Timburr, and its wide movepool leaves it with plenty of coverage and support options such as Fire Blast and Will-O-Wisp. However, its shabby offensive stats give it an underwhelming offensive presence, which can allow Pokemon such as Guts Timburr, Pawniard, and Scraggy to set up on it. Additionally, its mediocre HP and bad Special Defense mean it often can't take special hits. It is also fairly reliant on its Eviolite being present to tank a lot of hits.", "Toxapex": "Toxapex is one of the best defensive Pokemon in the OU metagame thanks to a combination of excellent natural bulk, multiple methods of recovery, and a key move in Haze, making it a great fit on stall and balance teams alike. Toxapex is one of the few viable Pokemon in OU with access to Toxic Spikes, which gives it a method to passively wear down the opposition, and immensely pressures sweepers from setting up. Its Poison / Water typing furthers its defensive capabilities, letting it check a myriad of offensive threats such as Ash-Greninja, Magearna, Mega Scizor, Volcarona, and Mega Lopunny. Toxapex is able to effectively pivot into many attacks because of its insane bulk and Regenerator ability, allowing it to scout movesets with very little risk. However, abysmal offensive stats make Toxapex somewhat passive, and it relies on status to make up for this shortcoming. Despite its passive nature, Toxapex can be extremely difficult to take down without a dedicated answer to it, and is capable of stalling out many Pokemon that fail to break it.", "Infernape": "Infernape is among the UnderUsed metagame's premier offensive threats, thanks to its multitude of valuable traits. Between a great Speed tier, good mixed offenses, and access to both physical and special boosting moves in Swords Dance and Nasty Plot, Infernape is extremely offensively versatile, capable of running several different viable sets and always leaving its opponent guessing. Furthermore, Infernape's excellent STAB combination in tandem with the massive amount of coverage options at its disposal allows it to hit almost the entire tier for super effective damage, severely limiting its checks. Access to two powerful STAB priority attacks in the forms of Mach Punch and Vacuum Wave further bolsters Infernape's offensive prowess, allowing it to pick off weakened threats with relative ease. Unfortunately, Infernape can often suffer from four-moveslot syndrome, which prevents it from covering everything it'd like to and allows certain Pokemon to check some of its sets. Infernape is also very frail without defensive investment, which leaves it extremely vulnerable to Pokemon that can hit it for super effective damage, such as Moltres and Mega Aerodactyl. Infernape also sits at a slightly exploitable Speed tier, given that big threats like Gengar and Latias can outpace and threaten it, which in tandem with its poor bulk can require intelligent play to put Infernape to full use.", "Dhelmise": "Dhelmise is a threatening wallbreaker thanks to its high base Attack and strong Grass-type STAB attack in Power Whip enabling it to OHKO the likes of Vaporeon and defensive Hariyama and 2HKO Pokemon such as Steelix, Whimsicott, and Mega Audino. Because of its typing and above-average bulk, Dhelmise finds multiple chances to switch in on resisted hits from Pokemon like Slowking, Heliolisk, and Sceptile while also functioning as a check to Pokemon like Passimian, Rhydon, and Torterra. Additionally, Dhelmise's ability Steelworker provides it with a 1.5x boost to the power of Heavy Slam and Anchor Shot, allowing the former to OHKO Pokemon such as Braviary and Xatu and heavily dent Vileplume. Dhelmise also has access to Rapid Spin and recovery in Rest and Synthesis, letting it function as a reliable source of entry hazard removal. Unfortunately, Dhelmise is plagued with weaknesses to common attacking types in Dark, Fire, Ice, and Ghost as well as a poor Speed tier, making it easy for Pokemon like Incineroar, Sneasel, Decidueye, and Rotom to revenge kill.", "Shellder": "Possessing immense physical bulk and passable Speed and Attack, Shellder has the right traits to pull off a successful Shell Smash set. Being a pure Water-type is also beneficial for Shellder, not only giving it a great number of setup opportunities but also making it neutral or resistant to all priority attacks. Additionally, Skill Link gives Shellder an edge over most other Shell Smash users, as it allows Shellder to circumvent Focus Sash Abra without giving up an important coverage move. Skill Link has some interesting quirks in LC, making Icicle Spear and Rock Blast hit far harder than their already impressive 125 Base Power would imply. However, Shellder heavily relies on Shell Smash to become a threat and can hardly afford not to run the move.", "Skorupi": "Skorupi manages to establish a niche for itself thanks to Toxic Spikes, its good Speed and Defense, and its decent defensive typing. However, the rest of its stats are subpar, its typing leaves it vulnerable to common Pokemon like Abra and Ponyta, and its niche as a Toxic Spikes user is better fulfilled by Pokemon like Mareanie. It is even further hindered by the prevalence of Poison-types in LC, such as Foongus, Grimer-Alola, and Croagunk, which can often switch into Toxic Spikes and absorb them.", "Dratini": "Dratini is able to perform as both a threatening wallbreaker and a late-game cleaner due to its access to strong offensive moves like Draco Meteor, Iron Tail, and Extreme Speed and a strong setup option in Dragon Dance. Its two main options are a mixed attacking set that utilizes Dratini's high-Base Power moves and good coverage to weaken the opposing team for sweepers or clean late-game and a sweeping set that utilizes Dragon Dance, since +1 Dratini is both fast and strong enough to clean up weakened teams. Dratini also has a useful ability in Shed Skin, allowing it to occasionally cure itself of debilitating status conditions like paralysis and burn. Dratini's typing is a mixed blessing, sporting very useful resistances to Water- and Electric-type moves but leaving it weak to moderately common Fairy- and Ice-type attacks. Dratini's positive qualities are also offset by its average-at-best stats, with low bulk and only middling power and Speed before a boost. Dratini further suffers from having common counters such as Snubbull, Magnemite, and Spritzee.", "Starly": "Starly's Speed, while acceptable, is not enough to compensate for its poor defensive stats and reliance on recoil moves that leave it exceedingly frail. Although it has coverage options in Hidden Power Grass and Heat Wave, Starly's horrid Special Attack renders these moves ineffective and non-threatening. Furthermore, a weakness to Stealth Rock hurts Starly's already low longevity. For these reasons, a myriad of Flying-types all outclass Starly: Doduo possesses higher Speed and Attack stats and Vullaby provides defensive utility or better offensive presence with its well-rounded stats and movepool.", "Aurorus": "Aurorus solidifies itself as one of PU's most threatening wallbreakers due to its good offensive typing, fairly high Special Attack, and access to high-powered STAB moves in Blizzard and Refrigerate-boosted Hyper Voice. Both of Aurorus's abilities are brilliant offensively, with Snow Warning giving it a perfectly accurate Blizzard and supplying chip damage on foes and Refrigerate making Normal-type moves into STAB Ice-type attacks and making them stronger. Its access to Freeze-Dry allows it to threaten Water-types that resist Blizzard and Earth Power gives it a way to pressure Steel-types, thus giving it perfect coverage. Aurorus is also capable of pulling off a Choice Scarf set to outspeed and KO some of its offensive checks that attempt to revenge kill it like Shiftry. Aurorus can also function as a lead for offensive teams, taking advantage of its typing allowing it to threaten most forms of entry hazard removal, Snow Warning helping Aurorus against Focus Sash and Sturdy users, and its access to decent support options like Encore and Stealth Rock. Snow Warning allows Aurorus to serve as a decent stop to weather teams, since the hail replaces the weather they had set up upon switching in. Unfortunately, Aurorus's solid bulk is offset by its bad defensive typing, which burdens it with a weakness to both Stealth Rock and common attack typings in Fighting, Grass, Ground, Steel, and Water, though it does leave Aurorus resistant to Normal. Furthermore, Aurorus is prone to being forced out by common offensive Pokemon such as Togedemaru because of its low Speed, forcing it to commonly employ a hit-and-run strategy.", "Mantine": "Mantine's typing and excellent special bulk let it handle menacing, commonplace attackers like Mega Blastoise, Ninetales, and Roserade. The high usage of these attackers means it gets opportunities to switch in against many teams, letting it use Defog with decent consistency, and the ability to run any two of Air Slash, Scald, and Toxic can make it tricky for offensive teams to safely respond to early-game. However, vulnerability to Electric-type attacks and Toxic renders it easily forced out by Pokemon that might have those moves. Registeel and Bronzong are prevalent Stealth Rock users that practically always have Toxic, so it's extremely difficult for Mantine to keep entry hazards away against teams with them. A Stealth Rock weakness means it often switches in with significant HP lost and is under a lot of pressure to clear hazards, and the high number of Stealth Rock setters that run Toxic makes this job even harder. It faces significant competition from Milotic, which boasts greater versatility by not requiring three specific moves and the ability to beat Steel-types by using Refresh. Only having one customizable moveslot means it'll be helpless against certain setup users depending on its fourth move; for example, using Haze over Air Slash makes Toxicroak a counter, and using Air Slash allows bulky Pokemon like Curse Snorlax to be a problem.", "Pineco": "Thanks to a great ability in Sturdy, a great Defense stat, and access to Stealth Rock, Spikes, Toxic Spikes, Rapid Spin, and Explosion, Pineco can function as a great suicide lead, as it can usually ensure that it gets its own entry hazards up while preventing your opponent from setting theirs up. However, Pineco is incredibly one-dimensional. Opponents will easily be able to predict a Pineco lead and act accordingly. Oftentimes, they will be able to set up on it, as it's very passive. It also has a very low Speed stat, meaning it will often be unable to set up multiple entry hazards and then go for Explosion. In addition, your team needs to prevent your opponent from removing Pineco's entry hazards in order to take advantage of them. Thus, a spinblocker and a Defiant user are mandatory, which restricts teambuilding a lot. Lastly, Pineco faces a lot of competition from the faster, stronger, and more versatile Dwebble.", "Golett": "Golett's niche lies in the fact that it is the only Pokemon in LC that can set Stealth Rock and block Rapid Spin at the same time, though it does lose to the most common spinner in the tier, Staryu. By virtue of its Ground / Ghost typing, Golett sports immunities to Normal-, Electric-, and Fighting-type moves, letting it hard counter non-Pursuit Munchlax and non-Shadow Ball Nasty Plot Croagunk while also beating Rock-types like Onix, Archen, and Cranidos. Golett is also one of the few Ghost-types available that aren't vulnerable to Alolan Grimer. Furthermore, its impressive Attack combined with Iron Fist allows Golett to hit decently hard, and its expansive movepool gives it coverage options to hit specific threats. However, Golett has fairly low Defense and Special Defense and is also slow, and its typing leaves it with glaring weaknesses to extremely common Dark-, Water-, and Grass-type moves. Because of this, it is unable to check most Fighting-types, fearing Knock Off. Golett is also vulnerable to common threats in Vullaby and Pawniard due to its typing. Golett faces competition from other Stealth Rock setters like Onix and Dwebble, which are faster and can check more Pokemon. Lastly, Golett also faces competition as a defensive Ghost-type from Pumpkaboo-XL, which has much more bulk and access to Synthesis and Will-O-Wisp.", "Doublade": "Doublade presents a unique pick for teams in the UU metagame as both a solid defensive pivot and a late-game sweeper. Doublade's defensive prowess stem from its monstrous Defense stat, access to Eviolite, and fantastic defensive typing. Its Ghost / Steel typing possesses nine resistances and three immunities, letting it check common threats such as Mega Aerodactyl, Latias, and Cobalion. Its respectable base 110 Attack and access to Swords Dance and STAB Shadow Sneak also make Doublade a formidable late-game sweeper, provided that its strong checks and counters have been weakened or removed. To counteract its fantastic physical bulk, however, Doublade's HP and Special Defense stats are much lower than it would prefer, leaving it to only rely on its typing to stomach strong special hits like Calm Mind Latias's +1 Devastating Drake. While it does possess a plethora of resistances, Doublade finds itself weak to common attacking types in Ground, Fire, and Dark, letting Pokemon such as Earthquake Terrakion, Fire Blast Mega Altaria, and Knock Off Scizor muscle past it after prior damage. Doublade's weakness to Dark-type moves also notably leaves it weak to Pursuit and Knock Off. The former often means that it is too weak to act as a defensive pivot, while the latter removes its Eviolite, hindering its overall bulk. Doublade also lacks any form of reliable recovery, meaning it is easily worn down by entry hazards and other damage accumulated throughout a match. Finally, Doublade has no use for its ability, No Guard, and it also makes opposing inaccurate moves like Fire Blast and Hydro Pump always hit.", "Shellos": "Shellos holds a unique niche over common bulky Water-types thanks to Sticky Hold, which allows it to permanently hold on to its Eviolite. It has a decent movepool that grants it access to Scald, Earth Power, Yawn, Clear Smog, and, most importantly, Recover. Shellos also has a solid defensive Water typing. However, said typing also means that Shellos will be vulnerable to common Electric- and Grass-types such as Chinchou, Magnemite, and Foongus. All of Shellos's base stats bar HP are relatively mediocre, meaning it has middling bulk, which allows powerful wallbreakers such as Abra, Snivy, and Rufflet to significantly weaken it, and Shellos's low offensive stats cause it to drain momentum while potentially being used as setup bait.", "Bonsly": "Bonsly is overwhelmingly outclassed in its role as a Stealth Rock user. It is utterly outclassed by Geodude, which boasts a better typing, better Speed, and the ability to viably run an Adamant nature, and Onix mostly outclasses Geodude thanks to its higher Speed and much higher versatility. Below these two Pokemon, Bonsly offers no redeeming qualities to differentiate itself from them, as the lessened weakness to Water- and Grass-type moves does not help it in any matchup, making it a completely unviable choice on any Little Cup team.", "Leafeon": "Leafeon can serve as an decent sweeper and wallbreaker thanks to its overall decent stats and access to a setup move in the form of Swords Dance. It also has a nice ability in Chlorophyll, which allows it to serve as a good sweeper on sun teams. However, its offensive movepool is somewhat shallow, and it has a mediocre offensive typing in pure Grass, often leaving Leafeon dependent on neutral coverage to pick up KOs. This leads to Leafeon struggling to break through certain bulky Pokemon, such as Oricorio-E and Tangela. Furthermore, while it can break through Pokemon such as Tangela with its Z-Move, this means it also takes up the team's dedicated Z-Move slot. It can also be relatively easily worn down through means such as Double-Edge's recoil. While its Speed is decent, it is not the best when the sun is not up, so Leafeon can still be relatively easily outsped and revenge killed by Pokemon such as Swanna and Froslass, especially with its poor HP, lacking Special Defense, and bad defensive typing. Leafeon receives a good amount of competition from other Grass-types both inside and out of sun, such as Victreebel and Shiftry. Both have secondary STAB moves and more coverage options, and Shiftry also has access to Sucker Punch and a good support movepool with moves such as Defog. However, Leafeon remains an overall decent choice thanks to its higher physical bulk and Attack and a typing that does not leave it weak to moves such as Mach Punch.", "Corphish": "Thanks to Adaptability and a decent offensive typing, Corphish is a fantastic choice for many offensive teams. A combination of Knock Off and Crabhammer means that even Pokemon that resist Crabhammer are usually unable to safely switch into Corphish more than once, rendering it an extremely potent wallbreaker. It is also very useful against offense, as its Adaptability Aqua Jet is one of the strongest priority moves in the metagame. Boosting moves such as Swords Dance and Dragon Dance allow it to attempt a sweep with a small amount of support. Corphish struggles somewhat with its mediocre bulk and sub-par Speed, but it is usually fast enough to outspeed most walls. However, despite its good movepool, it does not have enough moveslots to fit all the moves that it wants, and will sometimes struggle against common Pokemon such as Foongus and Croagunk.", "Arcanine": "Arcanine is one of RarelyUsed's prominent Fire-type Pokemon because it has the stats, movepool, and abilities to shine as a wallbreaker. Thanks to its good offenses and movepool, Arcanine can reliably 2HKO almost every defensive Pokemon in the metagame as well as threaten Stealth Rock setters such as Necrozma, Metagross, and Rhyperior. Flash Fire notably allows it to be one of the best counters to Ninetales in the tier. Arcanine also has a good Speed tier, outpacing offensive threats such as Roserade, Gardevoir, and Metagross. Despite those great traits, Arcanine's biggest flaw is that it is easily worn down by Stealth Rock, Flare Blitz recoil, and Life Orb, limiting the number of times it can safely switch in and compromising its potential as a check to Fire-types. Arcanine relies heavily on prediction, so one wrong prediction can leave it helpless against Pokemon such as Milotic, Mega Blastoise, and Golisopod. Fast threats such as Raikou and Zygarde-10% as well as common Choice Scarf users such as Tyrantrum, Drapion, and Flygon can outpace Arcanine. However, Extreme Speed does help against these threats if they are weakened. Arcanine faces competition as a Fire-type from Ninetales and Salazzle, which have better Speed tiers, boost their stats, and, in Ninetales's case, can reliably OHKO bulky Water-type Pokemon with Solar Beam. Arcanine also has competition as a Fire-type check with Houndoom, as Houndoom can also check Psychic-types and has a better matchup against bulkier teams.", "Hippopotas": "Thanks to incredible physical bulk complemented by a reliable recovery move in Slack Off, Hippopotas is capable of checking a huge variety of physical attackers in Little Cup including, but not limited to, Choice Scarf Doduo and Rufflet, Timburr, non-Life Orb Pawniard, and Archen. Because of this, it can function as a great Stealth Rock setter, capable of setting it up on many threats in the metagame. Hippopotas also has a decent Attack stat as well as access to Whirlwind, which together mean that it isn't setup bait. Its ability Sand Stream allows Hippopotas to remove hail, making it a decent check to hail teams. However, it has a low Special Defense stat that, in combination with a less-than-ideal defensive typing, can easily be taken advantage of, as it leaves Hippopotas open to common Grass- and Water-type moves. Its usual lack of a move to threaten Flying-types also means that it often can't fight back against some of the threats it walls. Hippopotas also has a bad matchup against two of the most common hazard removers, Staryu and Vullaby, meaning it is often unable to keep Stealth Rock set.", "Igglybuff": "At first glance, Igglybuff has a good HP stat and a wide movepool. However, all of its other stats are extremely poor, and it lacks enough unique utility options to distinguish itself at all from Spritzee. In a metagame dominated by Fighting-types such as Timburr and Mienfoo, not having that key Fighting-type resistance due to its Normal typing is brutal for Igglybuff, and its abysmal defensive stats are just another reason why Igglybuff is fully outclassed by Spritzee. Igglybuff does sport Competitive and Fire Blast, but these traits are not enough to warrant its use whatsoever when its overall stats and movepool are so poor.", "Noctowl": "Noctowl sports Tinted Lens, Work Up, and a powerful STAB move in Hurricane, making it capable of breaking past Pokemon that check other Flying-types such as Regirock and Lanturn. Access to Agility lets Noctowl double as a late-game sweeper by being able to outspeed prominent threats such as Alolan Raichu and Choice Scarf Primeape after a boost. The combination of these traits allows Noctowl to match up well versus offensive and defensive teams alike. Noctowl's respectable special bulk also grants it valuable setup opportunities versus weaker special attackers such as Weezing and defensive Mesprit. However, Noctowl's paltry base 50 Defense can prove troublesome, as common powerful attackers such as Togedemaru and Alolan Sandslash can outspeed Noctowl and OHKO it. By extension, +2 Modest Noctowl fails to outspeed particularly fast and threatening Choice Scarf users such as Togedemaru and Manectric. Even though Roost can somewhat remedy residual damage taken, a weakness to Stealth Rock means that Noctowl will often be forced to use Roost and miss out on chances to set up or fire off an attack. Furthermore, Noctowl is reliant on setting up and having a Z-Move to apply offensive pressure, as its middling Special Attack and mediocre Speed otherwise keep it from being a sizeable threat. Finally, Noctowl faces stiff competition from other Flying- and Normal-type wallbreakers and sweepers such as Oricorio-G and Drampa; the former can similarly break through balance and stall teams with its powerful STAB combination alongside access to a superior boosting move in Calm Mind, while the latter possesses far more raw power.", "Cofagrigus": "Cofagrigus's access to Nasty Plot and Trick Room makes it a potent sweeper in the UU metagame, particularly against offensively inclined teams, where it generally outspeeds every Pokemon while Trick Room is up. Its Ghost typing is good offensively, especially when paired with Ghostium Z, with STAB Shadow Ball only being resisted by Dark- and Normal-types like Hydreigon and Blissey. Cofagrigus also possesses great natural bulk, especially physically, granting it a solid number of setup opportunities and allowing it to act as a blanket check to certain physical threats such as Scizor and Mega Altaria. Ghost is rather mediocre defensively, though it does give Cofagrigus setup opportunities against Pokemon like Cobalion and Choice Scarf Infernape. Cofagrigus's ability Mummy helps it set up in the face of Pokemon such as Scizor and physical Mega Altaria that rely on their abilities to do meaningful damage. However, Cofagrigus is not particularly threatening without both Nasty Plot and Trick Room set up, often being either too weak to execute a sweep without Nasty Plot boosts or revenge killed by a faster Pokemon outside of Trick Room. It also struggles to break past any formidable special wall that is not hit at least neutrally by its Ghost STAB moves; examples include Blissey and Alolan Muk. While in theory Hidden Power Fighting offers fantastic coverage alongside Cofagrigus's STAB Shadow Ball, its low Base Power leads Cofagrigus to struggle against Ghost-resistant Pokemon such as Blissey and Mega Pidgeot, due to the former's great Special Defense and the latter's neutrality to Fighting-type moves.", "Snorlax": "As Snorlax continues to descend into lower tiers, it brings with it its tried-and-true Curse sets and manages to establish its perpetual dominance in the SM RU metagame as evident by its influential and consistent roles as a setup sweeper, wallbreaker, and defensive threat. Snorlax's Thick Fat ability in conjunction with its defensive stats allows it to check a variety of Pokemon, such as Nidoqueen, Salazzle, and Mega Glalie, while its ability to make use of Curse further bolsters its defensive prowess and enables it to sweep. Figy Berry opens up the option for a different spin on its conventional Curse set, making use of it with Gluttony and Recycle to give Snorlax a tool that capitalizes on its matchup versus offensive teams. Along with three great abilities, Snorlax possesses a movepool that complements its job as a wallbreaker and defensive Pokemon, granting it access to Pursuit, which can dispose of frail attackers like Swellow, Mismagius, and Espeon, alongside the necessary coverage moves and STAB attacks to break through physically bulky Pokemon such as Slowbro and Gligar. Snorlax, however, is forced to rely either on Rest, which oftentimes puts in situations where it has to compromise its team's momentum to stay in the game, or Recycle + Figy Berry, which makes it susceptible to status; its relatively low Speed means it will often be too offensively pressured to rely on these recovery options. Sets not using any form of recovery will usually be overwhelmed quickly, and Snorlax has a number of counters that can hold back its sweeper and Choice Band sets, requiring its teammates to provide additional support.", "Articuno": "Articuno carves itself a good niche in the PU metagame, as it has respectable bulk, a useful ability in Pressure, and a decent Speed tier. These traits allow Articuno to stall out and beat many passive foes in the tier, such as Clefairy and Audino. Articuno's good bulk also allows it to blanket check many offensive Pokemon like Mesprit, Lilligant, Skuntank, and Swanna and deal with them with its STAB moves in return. Articuno's STAB moves pressure a lot of defensive cores, especially those with Altaria, Poliwrath, and Tangela, and the small number of pure Steel-types makes its STAB moves easier to spam. However, Articuno does have a 4x weakness to Stealth Rock, which limits its opportunities to switch in freely. As a result, Articuno must be partnered with a teammate that can remove entry hazards. In addition, Articuno's poor defensive typing prevents it from being a fully defensive wall, and its average offenses make it too weak to be a fully offensive sweeper. Articuno competes with other Ice-types in the tier, namely Aurorus, Jynx, and Abomasnow, all of which are more versatile and stronger offensively. Despite outspeeding the likes of Mesprit, Skuntank, and Stoutland, Articuno sits in a slightly awkward Speed tier, leaving it outpaced by common threats like Kangaskhan, Primeape, and Togedemaru. Finally, Articuno has trouble in some matchups versus more offensively based teams, as it can be more easily pressured by strong wallbreakers. Those teams also tend to set up Stealth Rock more easily and are able to apply more pressure to the hazard remover.", "Roselia": "Roselia's bulk and defensive typing allow it to solidly check dangerous special attackers such as Jellicent, Lilligant, and Omastar. Its access to Spikes and ability to absorb Toxic Spikes give it good utility, and Synthesis and Natural Cure provide it with greater longevity than other entry hazard setters and allow it to absorb status. Furthermore, Roselia's good STAB combination and decent Special Attack prevent it from being overly passive and allow it to pressure removers like Lurantis and Hitmonchan in one way or another. However, Roselia's defenses are easily exploited due to its low physical bulk and reliance on Eviolite, and its otherwise good defensive typing leaves it vulnerable to Flying-, Ice-, and Psychic-types. This is especially notable because it enables removers like Alolan Sandslash as well as Skuntank to switch in and exploit it. Roselia also faces competition from other Spikes setters like Qwilfish and Froslass, as they're both faster, possess greater utility options, and have slightly greater offensive presences while still maintaining solid defensive presences.", "Rhyperior": "Rhyperior's combination of physical bulk, useful resistances, and offensive presence lets it be an effective Stealth Rock setter on offensive teams. A Rock / Ground typing makes for a fearsome STAB combination that enables it to threaten one of the most common Stealth Rock setters in Registeel and force a decent number of switches, especially if opting to wallbreak with its Choice Band set. Said typing also provides some great resistances in Fire, Flying, and Rock, making Rhyperior a good check to the likes of Salazzle, Noivern, and Choice Scarf Tyrantrum. Solid Rock somewhat makes up for Rhyperior's many weaknesses by letting it take a super effective hit from threats like Nidoqueen and +1 Zygarde-10% to KO back. However, it's easily forced out by common Pokemon like Milotic and Shaymin, which can be vexing for offensive teams to switch into. A lack of recovery outside of Leftovers and pathetic Speed make Rhyperior easy for strong attackers to pick off mid- or late-game.", "Golem": "Although Golem does face competition as a lead, it does boast rather impressive offensive presence as a result of its high Attack and unresisted STAB combination, which allow it to more easily pressure certain entry hazard setters and removers such as Qwilfish, Regirock, and Hitmonchan. Unlike most leads, Golem isn't reliant on Focus Sash to do its job because of its ability Sturdy, meaning that it can hold Weakness Policy and potentially augment its offensive presence even further. Additionally, Golem's access to Explosion gives it a powerful means of pressuring removers not to clear the field and immediately generating momentum for its team, while its access to Sucker Punch gives it the ability to threaten more offensive teams as well as compensate for its low Speed. However, Golem tends to be less consistent than other leads such as Omastar, Smeargle, Aurorus, and Crustle due to their access to solid support and utility options in Spikes, Spore, Encore, and Knock Off and their higher Speed. Golem also faces competition from Stealth Rock Aggron despite it not being a lead, as it boasts higher Speed, slightly greater offensive presence because of Head Smash, and access to Taunt. Taunt users like Weezing can easily prevent Golem from setting Stealth Rock because of its low Speed, and it's that same low Speed that can make pressuring removers difficult. Golem is also relatively predictable, as it struggles to reliably deviate much from its main set.", "Pinsir": "Mega Pinsir is an extremely powerful wallbreaker thanks to Aerilate and its high Attack, which can be boosted further with Swords Dance. It possesses good coverage options in Earthquake and Close Combat. Aerilate-boosted Quick Attack uniquely gives Mega Pinsir Flying-type priority that lets it pick off Pokemon like Volcarona and weakened Greninja, two troubling Pokemon for offense. Mega Pinsir is also faster than many other wallbreakers such as Mega Mawile, Mega Medicham, Mega Heracross, and Tapu Bulu, as well as some offensive Pokemon such as Garchomp and Tapu Lele due to its high Speed stat. However, Mega Pinsir's typing leaves it with a nasty Stealth Rock weakness, making solid entry hazard control support highly recommended, something that not many offensive teams are able to afford. It also faces slight competition for the Mega slot with Mega Medicham, Mega Mawile, and Mega Heracross, all of which are very scary wallbreakers that require less support and have more coverage options; Mega Mawile in particular has much more defensive presence. Mega Pinsir is also relatively frail on the special side and has a mediocre defensive typing.", "Incineroar": "Thanks to Incineroar's great Attack, incredibly wide movepool containing many support and coverage options, and ability Intimidate, it is a very flexible Pokemon in the NU metagame, being able to function as either a potent wallbreaker or a useful pivot. High base Attack and wide coverage make Incineroar one of NU's most potent offensive threats, which is only boosted by its access to the exclusive Z-Move Malicious Moonsault, which lets it OHKO nearly any Pokemon that doesn't resist it after a Swords Dance boost. A good defensive typing and great defensive stats combined with Intimidate mean that Incineroar has the natural bulk to take on Fire-, Ice-, and Dark-types. Intimidate also allows it to function as a very useful pivot, increasing its physical bulk, and helping it to support its team. However, a weakness to passive damage and no recovery moves means that it is easily worn down, which, combined with its low Speed stat, leaves it easily revenge killed.", "Pangoro": "Pangoro has a high Attack stat, two powerful STAB types, and the coverage to hit the entire tier for at least neutral damage. These traits combined with its access to Swords Dance and several strong offensive abilities, namely Mold Breaker and Iron Fist, cause Pangoro to present itself as one of the most dangerous attackers and wallbreakers in the tier, one that is tremendously difficult to prevent from KOing at least one Pokemon. However, Pangoro is very slow, and while it's not very frail, it has a rather vulnerable defensive typing that gives it annoying weaknesses to Fighting, Flying, and Fairy. While Pangoro is a respectable Fighting-type wallbreaker with its own merits, it does face competition with various other Fighting-types such as Emboar and Virizion.", "Banette": "Mega Banette relies on using Prankster Destiny Bond to put opponents into a double KO situation at best, and Banette massively benefits from gaining immediate access to Prankster the moment it Mega Evolves. Meanwhile, the fact that Destiny Bond cannot be used consecutively doesn't apply to Mega Banette; by alternating between Prankster Destiny Bond and an attack without increased priority, any faster foe without effective priority of their own is always subject to a KO by Destiny Bond, making Mega Banette an effective tool for halting setup sweepers. It also has tools to prevent opponents from attempting to stall out Destiny Bond's low PP, such as Taunt to force bulkier foes to attack and even Infestation to prevent switching. Being a Ghost-type to block Rapid Spin as well as having access to Prankster Taunt and Destiny Bond, Mega Banette is quite capable of preventing the opponent from clearing entry hazards off the field.", "Whirlipede": null, "Mudsdale": "Mudsdale is a great defensive Stealth Rock setter, using its solid bulk, Stamina, and Ground typing to keep massive threats such as Aggron, Lycanroc, Kangaskhan, Scyther, and Alolan Raichu in check. Because of Mudsdale's high Attack and powerful STAB Earthquake, it has decent offensive presence and is far less passive than other defensive Stealth Rock setters like Regirock and Clefairy are. Mudsdale's usable coverage options and previously mentioned high Attack also allow it to function as a decent wallbreaker with Choice Band. However, Mudsdale suffers from a low Speed of 35, meaning that it will likely take damage before it can use an attack. Its excellent Ground typing also comes with weaknesses to common types such as Water, Grass, and Ice. Mudsdale lacks recovery besides Rest and a potential Figy Berry, meaning that despite its good bulk and ability, it is prone to getting worn down by repeated attacks, status, and entry hazards. Finally, with an overall shallow movepool, Mudsdale is also fairly predictable and is considered a mediocre wallbreaker despite its high Attack, as all of its moves can easily be played around.", "Servine": "Servine's main niche is being a bulky Defog user that can take on most Stealth Rock users due to its Grass typing. Access to Contrary and Leaf Storm also allows it to boost its Special Attack while using a strong STAB move, and access to reliable recovery in Synthesis helps Servine stay around longer. A decent Speed tier also lets Servine outspeed base 80 Speed Pokemon like Mesprit and Shiftry. Servine's bulk is decent, but a mediocre defensive typing isn't anything to write home about, and as it relies on Eviolite, it is very susceptible to Knock Off and should be wary of Pokemon that commonly use it. A low Special Attack stat means that Servine won't be doing much damage until it gets a boost, meaning that Pokemon like Assault Vest Hitmonchan can take it on. Servine also lacks special coverage moves, leaving offensive sets limited to a Grass-type STAB attack and Hidden Power and forcing it to choose which Pokemon it wants to beat. Leaf Storm's low PP also limits how much Servine can break through a team. Furthermore, Servine faces competition as a Defog user from Pokemon like Skuntank and Shiftry, which have either a better typing or better utility. Its main competition is Lurantis, which has the ability to run physical or mixed sets, is stronger and bulkier, and can afford to run different items, though Servine's main niche over Lurantis is its Speed.", "Purrloin": "Purrloin finds a niche in the LC metagame because of its great support movepool with moves like Thunder Wave, Encore, Knock Off, Taunt, and U-turn. In combination with its ability, Prankster, this allows Purrloin to act as a disruptive pivot with good utility. However, Purrloin is heavily restricted by its mediocre bulk, even when invested, giving it few opportunities to utilize its movepool. It also has low offensive presence, restricting it to a support set. Prankster's inability to hit Dark-types also reduces Purrloin's niche significantly, making it unable to paralyze or use Encore on common Dark-type setup sweepers like Scraggy and Vullaby. A poor defensive typing makes Purrloin susceptible to extremely common Fighting-type priority like Mach Punch and Vacuum Wave. Purrloin faces heavy competition from Cottonee, another Prankster user with access to Memento, better bulk, and a better defensive typing, as well as from Alolan Meowth, a Dark-type pivot with better Speed and access to Parting Shot. However, Purrloin's ability to use both U-turn and Prankster gives it a small niche over these two Pokemon.", "Tauros": "Although Tauros's Speed tier and coverage options let it threaten Pokemon like Heliolisk, Steelix, and Garbodor, its inability to reliably break common defensive Pokemon like Regirock, Rhydon, and Palossand leaves it outclassed by wallbreakers like Heliolisk, Sceptile, and Magmortar that can bypass their checks with their coverage moves and sheer power. Tauros is further hampered by its lacking defensive traits, which make it difficult to switch in and set up safely against almost anything other than Xatu, while other wallbreakers like Incineroar and Alolan Exeggutor find multiple chances to come into battle thanks to their typing and abilities.", "Shelgon": null, "Raikou": "Raikou is one of the premier Calm Mind users in RarelyUsed thanks to its great stats and decent movepool, allowing it to take on a multitude of threats. Its great Speed means it can outpace most of the biggest threats in RarelyUsed, including Ninetales, Espeon, and Virizion, and Speed tie with Zygarde-10%. Its amazing Special Attack, powered up by Calm Mind as well as Z-Moves, allows Raikou to punch massive holes in just about everything in the tier for neutral damage with just Thunderbolt and Hidden Power Ice as well as its various coverage options like Aura Sphere, Extrasensory, and Shadow Ball. Its good bulk also allows it to be an effective user of Substitute, which can allow it to safely set up. Raikou is also a very versatile and unpredictable Pokemon; it can also be a decent wallbreaker with Choice Specs, a revenge killer with Choice Scarf, or a pivot with Assault Vest and can utilize many different Z-Crystals with its Calm Mind sets. However, while Raikou has decent mixed bulk for an offensive Pokemon, its noticeably lower Defense stat means that it's vulnerable to being revenge killed by Pokemon like Choice Scarf Tyrantrum, Assault Vest Machamp, Arcanine, and especially Ground-type coverage move users. Despite Raikou's high offensive stats, its damage output is rather unimpressive without a boost or a Z-Crystal, which can potentially leave it walled by common special walls such as Florges, Snorlax, and Goodra. It is also prone to being worn down by entry hazards and Toxic, which can shorten its sweep and reduce the number of times it can use Substitute. Despite these few shortcomings, Raikou is still unparalleled as an Electric-type in RarelyUsed.", "Greninja": "Greninja, courtesy of its stellar Speed tier and amazing ability in Protean, is one of the OverUsed metagame's premier offensive threats, as it is more than capable of pressuring both faster, offensively inclined teams and bulkier builds. Its expansive movepool is a major contributing factor to its potency as an offensive force as well: because it has such a high number of move options, it can circumvent would-be counters and defensive checks and leave one's opponent guessing at Team Preview. Additionally, Greninja is one of the few viable offensively inclined user of Spikes and Toxic Spikes, which it is a stellar user of. Greninja only truly falls short when it comes to bulk, which renders it incapable of taking even resisted hits repeatedly, and the inability to run every coverage move on one set.", "Arbok": "Despite not suffering from competition as a Coil user having decent abilities and a nice movepool, Arbok struggles to find its place. Its only average Attack and Speed and mediocre bulk make it a bad setup sweeper, give it a hard time setting up, and leave it easily revenge killed and walled by metagame staples, such as Oricorio-E and Jellicent.", "Porygon2": "Porygon2 has a solid niche on bulky offense teams, as it can spread paralysis with Thunder Wave and check a group of anti-offense Pokemon that no other Pokemon can, including Sharpedo, Swellow, Speed Boost Yanmega, and various Dragon Dance users such as Flygon and Feraligatr. It is one of the bulkiest walls thanks to its defensive stats alongside Eviolite and a solid Normal typing, which also lets it decently check many wallbreakers, such as Gardevoir, Roserade, and Mega Glalie. Porygon2 also has access to many good moves to help it at its job such as Thunder Wave, Foul Play, and the BoltBeam combination. Its ability Trace, which has decent utility in general, allows Porygon2 to copy abilities, such as Slowbro and Slowking's Regenerator, Mantine's Water Absorb, Alolan Persian's Fur Coat, and Kommo-o's Bulletproof. Despite these perks, Porygon2 can be handled due to its reliance on Eviolite, which makes it weak to Knock Off, and its inability to use Leftovers, which makes it easily worn down by entry hazards and other form of residual damage. It's also weak to Fighting-types, namely Heracross, Pangoro, Virizion, and Kommo-o, which are very common and can easily beat Porygon2.", "Mamoswine": "Mamoswine is a premier wallbreaker in UnderUsed thanks to its huge Attack stat and an excellent STAB combination, which offers nearly perfect coverage. It also has access to STAB Ice Shard, which can patch up its paltry Speed while picking off several top threats, such as Latias, Mega Altaria, and Mega Aerodactyl, when weakened. Moreover, Mamoswine can support its team with options such as Knock Off and Stealth Rock, increasing its overall utility. Unfortunately, despite hitting extremely hard, Mamoswine has a hard time actually coming into play due to its terrible defensive typing, which lacks useful resistances and gives it several common weaknesses, such as to Fighting and Water. Its poor defensive utility is further compounded by its unremarkable bulk and weakness to common priority moves like Bullet Punch and Aqua Jet, which compromises its ability to pressure slower threats in Scizor and Crawdaunt. Lastly, Mamoswine struggles with a below average Speed tier for an offensive Pokemon, which can leave it vulnerable to several of the tier's powerful faster threats, including Infernape, Cobalion, and Starmie.", "Trubbish": "Trubbish occupies a niche among entry hazard setters thanks to its ability Sticky Hold combined with its good bulk, defensive typing, and access to Spikes. Sticky Hold allows Trubbish to switch into the very common Knock Off without losing its Berry Juice and works well with Recycle, which lets it capitalize on its bulk and stay healthy while it sets up Spikes. This makes Trubbish a great wall to Fighting-types and the popular Pawniard. Trubbish's high bulk in conjunction with its high Speed enables it to reliably set up Spikes against almost any lead. However, Knock Off still deals extra damage to Trubbish because it is holding an item, giving users of the move a way to exploit its ability. Trubbish also often struggles with spinners, as they can easily remove the Spikes that it sets up, and Staryu and Drilbur in particular can threaten it with their STAB moves. Lastly, Trubbish's Poison typing makes it very vulnerable to the common Diglett.", "Chansey": "Chansey's monstrous HP and high Special Defense stats make it the bulkiest special wall in the tier, boasting the ability to reliably handle the majority of the special attackers that the OU tier has to offer. To further accentuate its defensive prowess, Chansey has access to a plethora of viable utility moves such as Stealth Rock, Toxic, Thunder Wave, and Heal Bell, which makes it a must on almost all stall teams. On the flipside, while Chansey's measly Defense stat is covered for by its gargantuan HP stat combined with heavy EV investment, Chansey is still overwhelmed by physical attackers with setup moves such as Swords Dance Landorus-T and Kartana. Chansey's defensive typing is also interesting; while a Normal typing grants it only a single weakness, it also means Chansey has no resistances and only a single immunity. Furthermore, as is the case for many defensive Pokemon, Chansey is relatively slow and somewhat passive, relying heavily on Seismic Toss or status moves in order to inflict damage, meaning it can be relatively easily exploited by a number of offensive Pokemon. Lastly, Chansey is heavily reliant on Eviolite, as without it, Chansey is significantly less bulky and greatly struggles to check some of the more powerful offensive threats that it is usually tasked to handle.", "Cosmoem": null, "Clauncher": "With access to U-turn to maintain momentum, Clauncher finds a very small niche in the metagame. Despite having the ability Mega Launcher, it doesn't have many moves that can capitalize on it and its very average base stats prevent it from achieving any significant damage output. Staryu, Chincou, or Carvahna are better options if you need an offensive Water-type on your team.", "Plusle": "Plusle should never be considered over other Electric-types such as Alolan Raichu, Togedemaru, and Rotom-F, as they are far more potent offensively, having better movepools and secondary typings to boot. Plusle also lacks the defenses to safely set up, and even with decent Speed and a Nasty Plot boost, its offensive presence is very underwhelming.", "Geodude": "Geodude is a decent Stealth Rock user, as its Sturdy ability in conjunction with a Berry Juice usually guarantees that it will set up Stealth Rock. However, it is largely outclassed by Onix in this role, as its superior Speed stat, unpredictability in ability options, and access to more utility moves like Taunt and Roar make it function much better as an entry hazard lead. Geodude does boast a far greater Attack stat and a nice movepool, though, containing Sucker Punch as a priority option, a very powerful Explosion, Counter to smack physical attacking foes back, and great STAB moves to take advantage of Geodude's amazing offensive typing, all of which give it a good offensive presence and make it function as a better suicide lead for offense teams. Like Onix, Geodude suffers with a bad Special Defense stat and mediocre HP stat, which coupled by its terrible defensive typing that gives it a 4x weakness to Water and Grass as well as other weaknesses to common types like Fighting and Ground, makes it mediocre defensively, though Sturdy does mitigate this hindrance.", "Politoed": "Without Drizzle, Politoed is a generic ho-hum defensive Water-type in the metagame. Politoed is average and does not perform any role exceptionally well. While not necessarily bad, it lacks the practicality and utility of other defensive Water-types such as Jellicent due to its convenient secondary typing, access to moves like Will-O-Wisp and Taunt, and reliable recovery. Politoed fails to keep up with the abundance of threatening wallbreakers such as Stoutland and setup sweepers such as Lilligant.", "Donphan": "With its solid typing and great Attack and Defense, Donphan is a reliable tank in RarelyUsed that can check top threats in the tier such as Zygarde-10%, Noivern, and Tyrantrum. Donphan is also unique in that it has access to Rapid Spin to clear away entry hazards and Ice Shard as a priority move to pick off weakened threats such as Zygarde-10%, Roserade, and Noivern. Despite these solid traits, Donphan's biggest issue is that it is easy to wear down with weak attacks and status conditions thanks to a lack of reliable recovery. This is especially bad considering Donphan has to repeatedly switch into Pokemon it is supposed to check and entry hazards to clear them away, breaking its Sturdy ability every time. Donphan may have a high Attack, but it has issues breaking common defensive Pokemon such as Milotic, Mandibuzz, and Mantine. Donphan's low Speed and Special Defense are easily exploited by Pokemon that can hit it with super effective attacks such as Mega Blastoise, Roserade, and Milotic. While Donphan's typing and bulk allows it to check Rock-, Ground-, and Steel-types, it is still largely outclassed by other entry hazard removers such as Mega Blastoise, Mandibuzz, and Mantine thanks to either stronger offensive presences with Mega Blastoise or better resistances and recovery with Mandibuzz and Mantine. It also has competition as an offensive Ground-type from the likes of Zygarde-10% and Rhyperior. Zygarde-10% is much faster and has a better STAB move with Thousand Arrows, while Rhyperior has a higher Attack and better typing both offensively and defensively.", "Noibat": "Noibat is the only decent user of Infiltrator, carries a good movepool, and has good resistances to Fighting-, Water-, and Fire-type moves that may make it seem good to use. However, it is awful due to its mediocre stats, as it struggles to do good damage to Pokemon even with Life Orb to live attacks because of its poor bulk. It is outclassed by other Flying-types like Vullaby and Doduo because of their better attacking stats, bulk, and Speed that allow them to contribute to the team in ways that Noibat cannot.", "Croagunk": "Croagunk's unique typing and ability let it compress a variety of roles into a single team slot and serve as a fantastic glue Pokemon for offensive teams. Due to its typing, Croagunk has resistances to the common Fighting- and Dark-type moves, and due to its Dry Skin ability, it has a pseudo-immunity to Water. With these resistances, Croagunk becomes one of the few Pokemon in Little Cup with the ability to check all of the Pokemon that rely on these types, such as Chinchou, Mienfoo, Timburr, Pawniard, and Carvanha. Croagunk's typing is helpful offensively as well, as the only relevant Pokemon that resist its STAB coverage are Ghost-types, which it can hit with Knock Off, and other Poison-types. Additionally, Croagunk's wide movepool and acceptable all-around base stats allow it to customize its moveset and thus fit on a wide variety of teams. Access to Knock Off and various forms of priority, including Sucker Punch and Vacuum Wave, further improve Croagunk's ability to support its teammates. However, Croagunk's typing gives it weaknesses to the common Flying- and Ground-type moves and a susceptibility to being trapped and KOed by Diglett. Additionally, Croagunk's Speed is quite low, which leaves it susceptible to being revenge killed by a large portion of the metagame, though its access to priority somewhat remedies this.", "Primeape": "Primeape can function as either a revenge killer with its Choice Scarf set or a fearsome wallbreaker with its other sets. Primeape, being one of the few Fighting-types with access to U-turn, is beneficial for providing momentum for its teammates and pivoting out on predicted switches. Primeape also has access to Defiant, which allows it to deter Defog very effectively. Primeape is also somewhat unpredictable, as it is able to run multiple sets, items, and coverage moves. Despite these attributes, Primeape has mediocre bulk and struggles to break past bulky Ghost-, Poison-, and Psychic-types without a moderate amount of team support. Furthermore, common balance walls such as Gourgeist-XL, Weezing, and Musharna make using STAB Close Combat a liability. Base 95 Speed is also a crowded Speed tier for non-Choice Scarf users, with Primeape finding trouble effectively revenge killing Jynx, Silvally Ghost-and -Fairy, and Haunter without forcing a Speed tie. Lastly, the popularity of Mesprit means Primeape now has a check on most offense and balance builds.", "Hoothoot": "Hoothoot is an outclassed Flying-type Pokemon with low stats across the board and a weak movepool. Insomnia allows it to be a counter to Foongus' Spore, but Hoothoot will still find itself too weak to be of much use and outclassed by Overcoat Vullaby.", "Relicanth": "Relicanth faces stiff competition from the other offensive Rock-types such as Kabutops, Carracosta, and Lycanroc. Relicanth is held back by its low Speed and a middling base 90 Attack stat, not hitting as hard as other wallbreakers, especially Aggron. Relicanth's poor special bulk and common weaknesses also hold it back. Additionally, Relicanth struggles with many common Pokemon in the metagame such as Quagsire and Poliwrath, limiting its effectiveness as a wallbreaker.", "Tyrogue": null, "Decidueye": "Decidueye is a threatening wallbreaker and sweeper thanks to Swords Dance and Sinister Arrow Raid allowing it to beat would-be checks such as Steelix, Garbodor, Vileplume, and Druddigon. Decidueye's Grass / Ghost typing lets it threaten many metagame staples such as Rhydon, Dhelmise, and Slowking while also giving Decidueye several opportunities to set up with Swords Dance. Access to priority moves allows Decidueye to prevent faster, frailer threats like Heliolisk, Rotom, and Vivillon from revenge killing it once it has set up. Thanks to its solid special bulk, great utility options in Roost, Defog, and U-turn, and ability to threaten common entry hazard setters like Piloswine, Steelix, and Rhydon, Decidueye can also function as a reliable form of entry hazard removal. Unfortunately, Decidueye relies heavily on both its Z-Move and boosting with Swords Dance to defeat its checks. Additionally, Decidueye cannot reliably beat Incineroar, Guzzlord, and Braviary without Fightinium Z and Low Sweep, making it difficult to sweep with if the opponent has one of these Pokemon. Decidueye's typing leaves it vulnerable to Fire-, Dark-, Ice-, and Flying-type Pokemon like Houndoom, Sneasel, Mega Glalie, and Vivillon. Decidueye is also easy to Pursuit trap due to its underwhelming physical bulk. Although Decidueye's access to priority moves such as Shadow Sneak and Sucker Punch lets it threaten faster Ghost- and Fire-types like Rotom, Mismagius, and Delphox as well as faster, frailer attackers, other Pokemon like Braviary, offensive Garbodor, Absol, Golbat, and Choice Scarf Passimian aren't threatened as greatly by Decidueye's priority moves and can revenge kill it with ease. Additionally, Decidueye's priority moves are weak and can't reliably sweep through teams unless defensive Pokemon are removed first.", "Sawsbuck": "Access to Chlorophyll and a boosting move in Swords Dance allows Sawsbuck to become a formidable sweeper under sun, outspeeding every unboosted threat in the PU metagame, including Choice Scarf users such as Primeape and Togedemaru, even with an Adamant nature. One of Sawsbuck's main perks over other sun-based sweepers is its access to Jump Kick, which enables it to easily whistle past Steel-types such as Aggron and Alolan Sandslash, threats that the likes of Leafeon otherwise struggle to deal with. STAB Double-Edge, boosted by Swords Dance and Normalium Z, also allows Sawsbuck to break through physically defensive walls like Weezing and Tangela. Unfortunately, despite Sawsbuck's solid Speed, it's still dependent on sun being active to function, as threats such as Jynx and Primeape outspeed it otherwise and OHKO it. Sawsbuck's defensive typing also gives it six weaknesses to common types including Fighting, Flying, and Ice, making it easy to revenge kill should sun not be up. Users of Mach Punch such as Hitmonchan and Gurdurr are especially threatening, as they always hit Sawsbuck first with a super effective move and punch through its mediocre defenses. Furthermore, setup is mandatory in order for Sawsbuck to power through foes, and finding time to set up is difficult given its several aforementioned weaknesses. The prevalence of bulky Calm Mind Oricorio-G is a major roadblock for Sawsbuck, as it possesses a resistance or immunity to all of its attacks. Lastly, Sawsbuck competes with Leafeon and other Chlorophyll users such as Shiftry for a teamslot, as these Pokemon possess their own useful traits such as high physical bulk and STAB priority in Sucker Punch, respectively.", "Dialga": null, "Amoonguss": "Amoonguss's good defensive typing and mixed bulk make it a reliable defensive pivot. Key resistances to Grass, Electric, Water, Fairy, and Fighting enable it to check a large number of threats such as Primarina, Mega Altaria, and Zeraora, giving it a place on many balanced and bulky offensive teams. Amoonguss is able to do this reliably because of Regenerator, which gives it one-third of its maximum health upon switching out, making it hard to wear down. Another fantastic trait of Amoonguss is Spore, which lets it inflict guaranteed sleep on non-Grass-types. Despite Amoonguss's strengths, however, it possesses crippling weaknesses to Ice, Fire, Psychic, and Flying, which is amplified by the strong presence of Pokemon such as Mega Aerodactyl, Mamoswine, Moltres, and Latias. Amoonguss is also very passive because of its pitiful Speed stat and low offenses, which can make it setup fodder after Spore's been used.", "Jolteon": "Jolteon is a mediocre Pokemon. While it has good speed, its coverage options are limited to Hidden Power and Shadow Ball, which heavily limits its potential against offensive teams. Furthermore, although Jolteon's Special Attack is solid, it fails to break the most common special walls in RU such as Snorlax and struggles with bulky offensive threats such as Shaymin. Jolteon is also really frail, making it difficult to switch in even on resisted attacks and easy to revenge kill.", "Swablu": null, "Kricketot": null, "Heatmor": "Although Heatmor has decent offensive stats and a good STAB move in Fire Lash, it struggles to make good use of them properly because it is too slow to do anything and is outsped by most viable offensive pokemon, such as Stoutland, Kabutops, and Skuntank. Furthermore, thanks to its low defenses, Heatmor is unable to take hits well whatsoever and finds itself facing competition from Combusken, which can utilize Eviolite, has a secondary Fighting typing, and has Speed Boost and Swords Dance, making it a more reliable Fire-type wallbreaker.", "Golduck": "Despite a solid movepool and decent offensive stats, Golduck is simply outclassed by other Pokemon in the metagame as a rain sweeper such as Ludicolo, Floatzel, and Omastar. Nevertheless, it is otherwise effective in its role as a rain sweeper.", "Chimchar": "Chimchar is most commonly used as a suicide lead with Fake Out and Stealth Rock while holding a Focus Sash. However, it struggles against the likes of opposing Stealth Rock setters such as Dwebble and Tirtouga. Its own weakness to Stealth Rock means that it struggles to come in repeatedly to reset the entry hazard. Without the longevity, speed, or raw power of other Stealth Rock setters, Chimchar is not worth wasting a team slot on.", "Chesnaught": "Chesnaught is a reliable physically bulky Spikes user that has access to recovery in Synthesis, enabling it to get the entry hazard up several times in a game. Bulletproof helps it out defensively, providing it with immunities to common moves such as Gengar and Chandelure's Shadow Ball and Stakataka's Gyro Ball. Its Grass / Fighting typing combined with Chesnaught's high Defense helps it switch into several key physical attackers such as Krookodile, Zeraora, and Bisharp. However, while this typing helps Chesnaught greatly against many physical threats, it also leaves Chesnaught critically weak to several powerful attackers such as Latias, Togekiss, Moltres, and Mega Altaria. This, combined with its passivity, gives several free turns to threatening setup sweepers like Calm Mind Latias, Swords Dance Scizor, and Dragon Dance Mega Altaria. Furthermore, while Chesnaught offers several utility options and more physical bulk, it still competes with Klefki as a Spiker, which is faster, has access to Prankster and a variety of status moves, and has a typing that can check threatening Dragon-types.", "Sandile": "Sandile's high Attack and decent Speed make it a decent Choice Scarf sweeper, especially when combined with its unique Dark / Ground typing, which very few Pokemon resist, and its fantastic ability, Moxie, which boosts its Attack each time it scores a KO. It also has good coverage moves, such as Fire Fang, that allow it to surprise slower would-be counters, hitting them even harder after Moxie boosts its Attack. However, Sandile is weak to several common offensive types such as Water, Grass, and Fighting, as well as to common priority moves such as Mach Punch, Vacuum Wave, and Aqua Jet, which is further compounded by its terrible bulk. Its mediocre Speed also means that it's reliant on a Choice Scarf in order to not get outsped and OHKOed, which means that it can be very difficult for Sandile to get going, as the opponent can just switch in a Pokemon that resists the move Sandile is locked into. Its lack of Knock Off and recovery moves also means that it faces stiff competition as an offensive Dark-type from Pawniard and Vullaby and as an offensive Ground-type from Diglett, which is faster and hits harder before Moxie.", "Gible": "Gible fits on offensive teams that appreciate its ability to use offensive pressure to set up Stealth Rock without losing momentum. This is due to its incredible offensive typing, which gives it perfect neutral coverage with just its STAB moves and one coverage move, Fire Blast. Dragon / Ground also is a unique defensive typing, as it lets Gible resist Fire, be immune to Electric, and be hit neutrally by Grass, allowing it to check a decent range of Pokemon like Ponyta, Larvesta, and Elekid. Its ability Rough Skin punishes physical attackers that use contact moves to attack it, though Little Cup's low HP stats mean that Rough Skin does little damage. However, Gible is quite slow, so it struggles to set up Stealth Rock against a lot of foes. In addition, Fairy-types such as Spritzee and Snubbull, which Gible struggles to break through, are very common, while its weakness to Ice means that it can easily be taken down with common coverage moves such as Ice Beam on Staryu or Chinchou. It lacks reliable recovery, so it is unable to set up Stealth Rock multiple times throughout the game, especially when combined with its average bulk. Gible also faces competition from other Ground-types such as Mudbray and Drilbur, both of which are stronger while Drilbur is also faster; other Dragon-types such as Axew and Tyrunt, which have access to Dragon Dance, though Gible has a niche in its excellent neutral coverage; and other Stealth Rock setters like Ferroseed and Onix, which can set Stealth Rock up more reliably thanks to their greater bulk or better ability.", "Ekans": "Ekans carves itself a niche in LC as the only viable Coil sweeper, and it has quite an offensive presence after Coil boosts. Its expansive movepool includes many coverage moves like Earthquake and Sucker Punch to hit specific threats as well as utility options like Glare, and its typing grants it resistances to common Fighting-type moves as well as Fairy- and Poison-type moves, allowing it to check Pokemon like Timburr, Mienfoo, Spritzee, and Foongus. Furthermore, Ekans has great abilities in Intimidate, which lowers the foe's Attack, and Shed Skin, which can cure Ekans of status, easing its setup opportunities. These traits allow it to function well on offensive teams. Unfortunately, Ekans is fairly weak without Coil boosts, meaning it is easily played around. Ekans's main STAB move, Gunk Shot, has very low PP, so it has to worry about that when sweeping. Its typing leaves it vulnerable to common Ground-types like Diglett, which can trap and OHKO Ekans, as well as Mudbray and Onix. Ekans also is somewhat slow, so its sweeps can be stopped by fast, powerful attackers like Gastly and Abra. Lastly, Ekans faces competition from other Poison-types like Alolan Grimer and Croagunk, with the former having Poison Touch, Knock Off, and a better typing and the latter having a better typing, more setup opportunities, and greater power.", "Umbreon": "Umbreon is one of the premier clerics in RU thanks to its access to both Wish and Heal Bell, in addition to its incredible 95 / 110 / 130 bulk, which allows it to check a variety of threats such as Nidoqueen and Swellow. Furthermore, its access to Foul Play can be a detriment to the physical attackers that try to come in and use Umbreon for setup, so Pokemon like Flygon and Escavalier have to be careful about taking STAB Foul Play, as it can 2HKO them. That being said, Pokemon like Swords Dance Bewear, Calm Mind Florges, and Curse Snorlax take very little from it and can use Umbreon as setup fodder. In addition, its weakness to Fighting is bothersome with Virizion and Pangoro being very threatening to Umbreon and defensive teams in general.", "Xurkitree": "Despite that gnarly Special Attack stat, Xurkitree's other stats leave a lot to be desired. A measly Speed stat and below average bulk make it very easy for most teams to pivot around.", "Flaaffy": null, "Heracross": "Mega Heracross is one of the most powerful wallbreakers in the tier, being able to dismantle defensive teams with Swords Dance along with its high Attack stat. Having a unique defensive typing along with respectable bulk allows Mega Heracross to check many top-tier offensive threats such as Swords Dance Tapu Bulu and Gliscor as well as act as a solid Dark-type check. On the other hand, Mega Heracross's typing also leaves it weak to common types in Fairy, Flying, and Fire, and both of its STAB moves share common resistances, oftentimes being redundant in terms of coverage. In addition to its common weaknesses, Mega Heracross's poor Speed tier makes it easy to revenge kill for Pokemon like Tapu Lele, Mega Alakazam, and Mega Pinsir. Due to its tendency to fall against faster offensive threats, Mega Heracross tends to struggle against highly offensive teams.", "Feraligatr": "Feraligatr boasts one of the best abilities in Sheer Force, which coupled with its base 105 Attack, makes it a very hard Pokemon to switch into. This is further complemented by having access to Dragon Dance, which makes it a great sweeper, as well as Swords Dance which makes it a formidable wallbreaker. Feraligatr also has decent coverage options: Crunch is able to take on bulky Psychic-types, while Ice Punch handles most Grass-types in the tier, and both moves are boosted by Sheer Force. However, Feraligatr is rather slow, as it is outsped by several common Choice Scarf users such as Shaymin and Gardevoir. Feraligatr, however, has the raw bulk to keep itself from being revenge killed by faster Choice Scarf users that lack strong, super effective coverage options, making it a formidable sweeper.", "Toxicroak": "Toxicroak is one of the biggest nuisances for balance teams thanks to Dry Skin, which lets it use Pokemon like Milotic and Araquanid as setup bait, its immunity to Toxic, and access to Swords Dance. In fact, even offensive teams are forced to prepare for it because of Sucker Punch. It has the option to run Poisonium Z to flat-out invalidate checks to its Life Orb setsuch as Slowbro, Brave Bird Mandibuzz, and even Cresselia provided Stealth Rock is up. It also has further versatility by means of other potential sets such as Choice Scarf. Toxicroak's unique defensive typing allows it to check Pokemon like Virizion, Roserade lacking Hidden Power Fire, and Mega Blastoise in a pinch. However, although Toxicroak's Speed tier allows it to outpace common threats like Mega Blastoise, it leaves a lot to be desired with a good bit of the unboosted tier outpacing it, meaning Pokemon like Zygarde-10% and Salazzle can revenge kill Toxicroak as long as they aren't in range of Sucker Punch. Furthermore, Toxicroak has to compete with a plethora of other Fighting-types for a teamslot. For example, a team might prefer Virizion's Speed tier, Sawk's utility in Sturdy, Assault Vest Machamp's ability to act as a glue Pokemon, or Pangoro's immediate power over Toxicroak's assets.", "Voltorb": "Despite being one of only three Little Cup Pokemon to be able to reach the coveted 20 Speed benchmark, Voltorb\u2019s stats bar its Speed, as well as its movepool, leave it no choice but to take on a utility role of setting Light Screen and Reflect. Because Voltorb has to hold an item other than Eviolite to most effectively set dual screens, its bulk is lacking, allowing it to be severely chipped away at by priority users such as Pawniard and Timburr and common Choice Scarf users such as such as Mienfoo and Magnemite and OHKOed by a majority of strong neutral STAB attacks. Light Screen and Reflect are also not particularly noteworthy as a team strategy, as Memento users such as Cottonee and Aurora Veil users such as Alolan Vulpix perform this role more consistently, leaving Voltorb virtually outclassed in every role it can perform.", "Panpour": "With a vast amount of Water-types in LC, Panpour attempts to differentiate itself with Nasty Plot. However, it's not particularly good at that, as despite Eviolite, its low defenses make it hard for Panpour to set up. Additionally, there are many better offensive Water-types, notably ones that can use Shell Smash, like Tirtouga, Omanyte, Shellder, and Clamperl. Panpour's mediocre stats, including Speed, leave it in the dust of other setup sweepers.", "Cottonee": "Cottonee's Knock Off-resistant typing, expansive movepool, and fantastic ability in Prankster altogether make it one of Little Cup's best pivot and support Pokemon on offensive and balanced teams. Its plethora of useful resistances allows it to reliably check Fighting- and Water-type Pokemon such as Mienfoo and Carvanha, while its expansive utility movepool, consisting of Memento, Tailwind, and Encore, allows it to make full use of its ability and support its team. Furthermore, Cottonee has access to the coveted priority Z-Memento, which allows it to heal a teammate upon use and nearly guarantee their setup. Unfortunately, Cottonee's 4x weakness to Poison-type attacks makes it susceptible to getting KOed by surprise Poison-type coverage moves from Pokemon that it would otherwise check. Despite its Fairy typing, Cottonee is also unable to check most Dark-types due to its inability to hit them with moves affected by Prankster. Furthermore, Cottonee is weak to common attack types in Ice, Flying, Fire, and Steel, is quite frail without heavy investment, and lacks an outstanding offensive presence even with maximum investment.", "Dragonite": "Dragonite is an excellent user of Dragon Dance\u2014its sky-high Attack stat and access to Extreme Speed make it a difficult Pokemon to stop after it has boosted. Dragonite's ability Multiscale halves the damage Dragonite takes if it is at full health. This makes it easy for Dragonite to set up a Dragon Dance, even against foes with super effective moves. In addition, Z-Moves allow Dragonite to take advantage of its Flying STAB as well as stronger coverage options, enabling it to break through defensive Pokemon that would otherwise counter it, such as Skarmory, Tapu Fini, Slowbro, or Landorus-T, depending on the Z-Crystal Dragonite uses. However, because of Dragonite's low base Speed, it faces competition as a Dragon Dance user from Gyarados and Mega Gyarados. Dragonite is also very vulnerable to Stealth Rock, as it takes 25% damage from it upon switching in, losing Multiscale in the process.", "Lileep": "Lileep is arguably one of the best Water-type checks in LC. It has access to Storm Drain, a very handy tool that lets it absorb Water-type moves and boost its already decent Special Attack by one stage; this allows it to check the majority of Water-types in the tier, such as Chinchou, Mareanie, Tirtouga, and Corphish. It also sports impressive natural bulk that is further boosted by Eviolite, which lets it switch in on moves that are weak or resisted with ease. Furthermore, it has access to Stealth Rock, which is very useful for weakening the opposing team, and Lileep can easily set it up thanks to its bulk and its ability. On top of that, Giga Drain and Recover grant it solid forms of recovery and the ability to stay around for much longer. However, like most defensive Pokemon, Lileep has poor Speed, meaning that it will almost always take a hit before moving, and despite its decent Special Attack, it suffers from mediocre damage output, even after a Storm Drain boost. While it has impressive bulk, its typing leaves it weak to common Steel-, Fighting-, and Ice-type moves, with that last weakness being quite a nuisance because almost any Water-type that Lileep checks tends to carry Ice Beam. Finally, its tanking abilities are severely hindered by both Knock Off and Toxic.", "Vaporeon": "Thanks to its high all-around bulk and access to utility moves such as Wish, Toxic, and Heal Bell, Vaporeon is a premier defensive Water-type in the tier, checking prominent physical attackers such as Incineroar, Passimian, Sneasel, and Rhydon as well as special attackers such as Guzzlord, Houndoom, and Assault Vest Slowking. The combination of Wish + Protect lets Vaporeon both serve as an amazing support Pokemon, keeping Pokemon that don't have access to reliable recovery like Incineroar, Whimsicott, Dhelmise, and Silvally-Steel healthy, and maintain its own health. Because of its ability Water Absorb, Vaporeon is capable of handling opposing bulky Water-types like Blastoise and Slowking while also checking offensive Water-types like Samurott and Omastar. Unfortunately, although Vaporeon has a high HP stat, its physical bulk is lacking, making it easy for Pokemon like Medicham and Dhelmise to pressure it. Additionally, Vaporeon's passivity and reliance on Toxic for damage invite in threatening setup Pokemon like Substitute + Bulk Up Braviary, Taunt + Calm Mind Comfey, and Bulk Up Scrafty that can circumvent Toxic in some way. While Vaporeon's special bulk is great, it can still struggle with common specially offensive Grass- and Electric-type Pokemon like Whimsicott, Sceptile, Heliolisk, and Rotom.", "Swadloon": null, "Dragonair": null, "Smoochum": "Smoochum struggles to be viable despite its rather appealing STAB combination and acceptable Speed tier. Due to its terrible defenses and the presence of faster and more powerful Pokemon that outclass it such as Abra and Gastly, Smoochum is better left off of the team.", "Klinklang": "Klinklang is a very fearsome sweeper because of its access to Shift Gear. Its Steel typing gives it a few useful resistances, which, in conjunction with its good natural bulk, allows it to set up on many threatening Pokemon such as Garbodor, Sneasel, and Whimsicott. Unfortunately, Klinklang struggles to do anything to sturdy checks like Steelix, Silvally-Steel, and Pyukumuku, which can all hard wall Klinklang due to its lack of coverage options. While Klinklang does have a good number of resistances, it's also weak to a lot of common types such as Fire, Fighting, and Ground; however, it can work around the latter and potentially use Ground-types as setup bait with Magnet Rise.", "Terrakion": "Terrakion is one of the strongest wallbreakers in the UU tier thanks to its high Attack stat and amazing STAB combination. It can also work as a fearsome setup sweeper with Swords Dance, as it's able to pressure and break through a lot of stall and balance teams. Despite facing competition from other Fighting-types like Infernape and Heracross, Terrakion sets itself apart from them due to its ability to beat common Fighting-type answers like Togekiss and Moltres, its better Speed tier, and its access to Justified. However, Terrakion's typing is very poor defensively, making it easily exploitable and weak to a lot of priority moves like Bullet Punch, Mach Punch, and Aqua Jet and common typings, such as Steel, Psychic, Ground, and Fighting. The Defense and Special Defense drops caused by using Close Combat only aggravate this weakness. On sets utilizing a Z-Move, Terrakion can be easily exploited by bulky threats like Swampert and Alomomola that can tank a hit from it and cripple it after it has used its Z-Move. Terrakion is also outsped by a lot of common threats in the metagame, such as Latias and Gengar, meaning it can have a hard time sweeping.", "Conkeldurr": "Although Conkeldurr boasts respectable physical bulk and power, it suffers from a terrible Speed stat and typing, leaving it susceptible to the Psychic-, Fairy-, and Flying-types that plague the tier. Offensively, Conkeldurr is completely outclassed by other hard-hitters such as Mega Medicham, which is significantly more powerful and holds a much better Speed tier, and Mega Mawile, which possesses better coverage and defensive utility. These poor qualities leave Conkeldurr severely outclassed and without any reason to be used in OU.", "Gastly": "Gastly is a fantastic Pokemon in the LC metagame thanks to its very good Speed stat, which allows it to offensively check tier titans such as fast Mienfoo and Snivy, and its top-tier Special Attack stat, which allows it to put enormous pressure on teams and reliably break down opposing walls. Its movepool leaves it with a plethora of coverage options that make it extremely difficult to switch into, and even includes reliable support moves such as Will-O-Wisp and Destiny Bond. Gastly's Ghost typing also comes with significant advantages, giving it an immunity to Fighting-type priority moves and allowing it to act as a risky spinblocker for hyper offensive teams. However, Gastly's poor defensive stats and weakness to the common Dark-type leave it prone to being taken out by anything it doesn't KO.", "Mothim": "Mothim is in almost every way outclassed by Lilligant as a Quiver Dance user with its access to Sleep Powder and higher Speed. That being said, Mothim's small niche lies in its better mixed stats that allow it to hit hard with both offenses. Choice Specs sets can hit very hard with Tinted Lens, though it still struggles to KO bulkier Pokemon like Jellicent and Lanturn and also faces competition from stronger Choice Specs users like Mesprit, Aurorus, and the aforementioned Jellicent. It is also hindered by its low Speed and horrible Bug / Flying typing, but not all Pokemon can be winners.", "Toucannon": "Toucannon fills a rare niche in the PU metagame as a physically offensive Flying-type. Toucannon is the strongest Flying-type in PU and one of the few that have access to Brave Bird. Its role in the metagame is a strong wallbreaker capable of running strong mixed sets to break through bulkier Pokemon with help from its diverse coverage options. Boomburst and Brave Bird make Toucannon a tough Pokemon to switch into due to their high Base Power, difference in typing, and ability to let it inflict both special and physical damage. However, despite Boomburst being a very powerful STAB move, Toucannon's base Special Attack is very low and makes it difficult to deal with special walls like Munchlax and Type: Null without incurring massive recoil. Toucannon's lack of Speed and bulk also makes it very underwhelming against offensive teams and makes it hard to get off an attack at all. Toucannon is also prone to being revenge killed easily and worn down by Life Orb, Stealth Rock, and Brave Bird recoil.", "Teddiursa": "Teddiursa can boost its mediocre Speed with the combination of a Toxic Orb and Quick Feet, which, in conjunction with its access to Facade, allows it to perform as a fairly fast and powerful sweeper. Quick Feet is a fantastic ability that essentially provides Teddiursa with a Choice Scarf after one turn in exchange for Toxic damage. After Quick Feet is activated, it outspeeds the entire unboosted metagame, and its high Attack stat and prevention of other status make it tough to handle. Despite this, Teddiursa is still outsped by Choice Scarf users, such as Mienfoo, Chinchou, and Pawniard. Teddiursa also has mediocre bulk, which means it can't switch into an attack for fear of being KOed. With Toxic constantly whittling down its health, Teddiursa is very susceptible to priority attacks like the common Mach Punch and Vacuum Wave, both of which are super effective too.", "Hypno": "Despite its above-average Special Defense and access to Wish, fierce competition from Audino relegates Hypno to taking on a more offensive role. With its decent special bulk, Hypno can utilize Hypnosis to gain free turns and set up Belly Drum safely. However, banking on Hypno to land Z-Hypnosis in the first place combined with the fact Hypno is still outsped at +1 by nearly every relevant Choice Scarf user makes it a bad setup sweeper to waste giving the Z-Crystal to. Hypno also is unable to break through certain Pokemon such as defensive Mesprit, Spiritomb, and Sableye.", "Machoke": null, "Porygon": null, "Audino": "Thanks to high defensive stats and a workable defensive typing, Mega Audino is one of NU's premier walls, able to take on a large variety of the tier's attackers. An excellent ability pre-Mega Evolution also allows Audino to easily keep itself healthy without needing to use a turn healing itself, helping it to reduce lost momentum. This combined with its Normal typing is usually enough to wall most of NU's special attackers, only requiring Audino to Mega Evolve if the resistances and extra bulk the Mega Evolution brings are needed. Mega Audino also has access to an extremely wide support movepool, including many options such as Heal Bell, Wish, and Encore, as well as a wide offensive movepool, giving it exceptional coverage. However, very lackluster offensive stats, especially before Mega Evolving, force Mega Audino to rely on Toxic to deal damage, or otherwise it can be fairly passive.", "Jumpluff": "Jumpluff is a niche Pokemon in the PU tier due to its ability to provide utility support for its teammates. Swords Dance and Strength Sap can turn Jumpluff into an unexpected offensive threat, bolstered by its nice Speed tier. Jumpluff has several other great utility moves, and options such as Sleep Powder, Memento, and U-turn allow it to support its teammates fairly effectively. Jumpluff also sports a decent typing that gives it an immunity to Toxic Spikes and Spikes and resistances to Water, Fighting, and Grass, though a weakness to Stealth Rock can hamper Jumpluff's longevity. However, Jumpluff's typing also gives it quite a few weaknesses, including a nasty 4x weakness to Ice and 2x weaknesses to Fire and Flying. On top of this, Jumpluff is quite frail and can't do much outside of its support role. Jumpluff also can't afford to hold an item such as Leftovers because it needs a boosted Acrobatics, which even then is very weak due to its abysmal Attack stat. Even after a Swords Dance, Jumpluff is incredibly weak. Lastly, despite Jumpluff's good Speed stat, it's in a crowded Speed tier and contends with other base 110 Speed Pokemon such as Alolan Raichu and Alolan Dugtrio.", "Drifloon": null, "Drapion": "Bearing a good offensive and defensive typing, above average Speed, access to Swords Dance, and access to useful coverage moves such as Aqua Tail and Earthquake, Drapion carves itself a niche as a decent sweeper and wallbreaker in RU. Its decent Speed allows it to outspeed common Pokemon like Roserade and non Choice Scarf Gardevoir to hit them super effectively with either its STAB attacks or its coverage moves. Drapion is an effective Z-Move user, capable of utilizing Hydro Vortex to break past bulky Ground-types that would otherwise check it such as Donphan and Rhyperior. Furthermore, Drapion is one of the few Pursuit trappers in the tier; it can trap dangerous Ghost- and Psychic-types such as Mismagius, Cresselia, Metagross, and Bronzong. However, while Drapion does have a few advantages over other Pursuit trappers such as Sneasel or Honchkrow, namely a better defensive typing and much better bulk, which let it more easily switch into the Pokemon it is meant to trap, the higher offensive threat the other Pursuit trappers pose is sometimes appreciated more. Furthermore, despite having decent Speed, Drapion still fails to outpace offensive Pokemon that can threaten it such as Flygon and Shaymin. Due to its low Special Defense, Drapion also is highly susceptible to strong special attackers that outpace it like Salazzle and Swellow. It also struggles a great deal to break through many defensive Pokemon such as Mandibuzz, Pyukumuku, and Milotic due to its somewhat lackluster Attack stat in comparison to other Choice Band and Swords Dance users. Drapion relies heavily on Choice Band, Swords Dance, and Z-Moves to boost its damage output, since its base 90 Attack otherwise causes it to be extremely underwhelming as a sweeper and wallbreaker.", "Probopass": "Probopass's near-exclusive access to Magnet Pull allows it to trap and either severely weaken or eliminate Steel-types such as Steelix and non-U-turn Togedemaru for teammates. Additionally, its excellent all-around bulk combined with a rare resistance to Ice means it can check dangerous attackers like Sneasel on a reasonably consistent basis. Furthermore, Probopass has access to a handful of useful utility moves like Stealth Rock. However, its typing hurts it because of the lack of resistances and weakness to common coverage from the Pokemon it wants to check, such as Hidden Power Ground from Comfey and Earth Power from Diancie. Probopass also faces heavy competition in the role of an Ice-type switch-in or Stealth Rock user from Pokemon like Togedemaru, Silvally-Steel, and Steelix, and its lack of recovery makes it easy to wear down throughout the match.", "Excadrill": "Excadrill's great defensive typing allows it to check a variety of Fairy- and Electric-types in the meta, primarily Tapu Koko, Magearna, and Tapu Lele, and access to Rapid Spin lets Excadrill support entry hazard-weak teammates like Volcarona. Sand Rush enables Excadrill to become a threatening sweeper, as it outspeeds the entire metagame in sand, and can boost its already great attack to even higher levels with Swords Dance. However, outside of sand Excadrill isn't very fast, which can leave it prone to breakers like Mega Medicham and Volcarona. Sand Rush Excadrill is almost always paired with Mega Tyranitar, a reliable sand setter, so this isn't too much of an issue. Alternatively, Mold Breaker can let Excadrill bypass Magic Bounce, letting it freely use Stealth Rock or Toxic on Mega Sableye. It's also useful for hitting Mimikyu through Disguise, and Pokemon with the Levitate ability, such as Mega Latios, Rotom-W, and Hydreigon. Unfortunately, without sand support, Excadrill's speed leaves a lot to be desired\u2014outside of the sand, Excadrill is outpaced by dangerous Pokemon such as Volcarona, Garchomp, and Mega Medicham. Excadrill additionally can struggle to break past common Flying-types like Celesteela, and Landorus-T.", "Bewear": "Bewear has an amazing base 125 Attack stat combined with a great offensive typing in Normal / Fighting, which lets its STAB moves hit all but Ghost-types for at least neutral damage. Also, it gets access to powerful STAB moves such as Double-Edge and Superpower as well as Swords Dance to boost its Attack even more, letting it break through the majority of the tier. It has a very high base 120 HP, allowing it to tank hits well. In addition, its Fluffy ability lets it take contact moves with ease and function as a check to many strong physical attackers such as Feraligatr. Bewear gets decent coverage options in Ice Punch, Earthquake, and Shadow Claw, allowing it to hit Pokemon that would otherwise give it trouble such as Metagross, Mismagius, and Jellicent. However, its Speed and Special Defense are pretty low, leaving it outsped by many Pokemon and easily revenge killed by special attackers.", "Solosis": "Although Solosis is almost completely overshadowed by Abra as an offensive Psychic-type, it finds a small niche for itself on dedicated Trick Room teams as an offensive Trick Room setter due to its horrendous Speed and huge Special Attack stat, tying with Abra for the highest Special Attack stat in the tier. Solosis is also blessed with an excellent ability in Magic Guard, which allows it to avoid all passive damage, and has access to Thunder, which lets it nail Vullaby for much higher damage than other Psychic-types are able to. However, Trick Room teams aren't particularly reliable or consistent in Little Cup, and Solosis's middling bulk and mediocre defensive typing mean it may struggle to justify use on Trick Room teams over alternate setters like Spritzee. In addition, Solosis's overreliance on Trick Room being active to sweep makes it almost useless outside of Trick Room teams due to its lacking Speed. Most teams should use Abra for their wallbreaking needs.", "Gurdurr": "Gurdurr has just the right tools to succeed as both a Bulk Up sweeper and a defensive check to a large portion of the PU metagame. Gurdurr has great bulk that is further boosted by Eviolite, allowing it to act as a very effective blanket check to physical attackers. It has a small but very useful movepool, including recovery in Drain Punch, priority in Mach Punch, and utility in Knock Off. Also, Gurdurr's ability Guts allows it to take advantage of a plethora of defensive Pokemon in the tier that can only meaningfully damage it with status. However, Gurdurr's special bulk is subpar, so it can be easily taken advantage of by common special attackers like Mesprit. Additionally, its only form of recovery, Drain Punch, is very unreliable, so it can be worn down throughout the match. Finally, because Gurdurr is reliant on Mach Punch to deal with faster Pokemon, they can easily exploit Gurdurr, especially if they are resistant or immune to Mach Punch like Oricorio-G and Mesprit.", "Timburr": "Timburr has a myriad of positive traits that make it one of the best bulky attackers in the Little Cup metagame. Its high Attack stat and good bulk give it increased longevity and the ability to hit hard, and its Fighting typing is good both offensively and defensively. Timburr can take advantage of these traits with STAB Drain Punch, which gives it a recovery option, and Mach Punch, which is a reliable form of priority. To complement its STAB moves, Timburr has a good selection of coverage options, including Knock Off, Poison Jab, and the elemental punches, which allows it to hit its checks, and it also has access to Bulk Up, which turns it into a frightening late-game wincon. Timburr's abilities don't hurt either, with Guts giving Timburr the ability to switch into status-inducing moves without fear and Iron Fist boosting the power of many of Timburr's attacks. Timburr is held back, however, by its poor Speed stat, which leaves it outrun by most of the metagame, and its tendency to being worn down hurts its ability to reliably switch in over the course of a match. It also suffers from four-moveslot syndrome to an extent, as it has to choose whether to run a coverage move that hits Flying-types or one that hits Fairy-types.", "Steenee": null, "Sawk": "Sawk manages to carve a niche for itself among RU's Fighting-type Pokemon for a few reasons. It hits pretty hard and has solid coverage overall with moves like Knock Off and Poison Jab, and a solid Speed tier places it above common metagame threats like Mega Blastoise and Nidoqueen. Sawk's Sturdy ability gives it a huge niche in general as a catch-all answer to many offensive threats and also allows it to check setup sweepers like Barbaracle in a pinch. Due to its good Speed tier, Sawk can afford to run utility moves like Taunt that other Fighting-types in the tier cannot. However, Sawk is pretty frail and outpaced by many offensive threats such as Swellow, Roserade, and Zygarde-10%.

As a faster Fighting-type, it also faces competition with Virizion, Toxicroak, Medicham, and Passimian.", "Rotom-Wash": "Rotom-W has a great Electric / Water typing that is made even greater when paired with Levitate, which makes its Electric typing far less exploitable. Levitate lets Rotom-W handle Ground-types like Gliscor and Mamoswine with its STAB Hydro Pump and act as one of the best Flying-resistant Pokemon to check terrifying offensive threats like Tornadus-T, Flyinium Z Gyarados, and Mega Pinsir. Levitate, when paired with its resistances to Water, Ice, and Steel, also allows Rotom-W to act as a solid defensive pivot against Mamoswine, Landorus-T, and Mega Swampert. Sadly, Rotom-W's low HP stat and lack of recovery outside of Leftovers and Pain Split greatly hamper its ability to act as a bulky pivot. Furthermore, its lack of recovery means it is severely hampered by status effects, such as burn and Toxic poison. Even with its access to Levitate, Rotom-W struggles to check the majority of the Ground-types in the tier, as they are capable of exploiting Rotom-W's issues with chip damage and coverage moves.", "Patrat": null, "Stunky": "With access to Pursuit and Sucker Punch, Stunky is able to trap and remove strong special attackers like Gastly and Abra very easily. Stunky also is able to carve its own niche as a Pursuit trapper that can remove hazards from the field. Its very nice defensive typing grants it an immunity to Psychic-type moves and a weakness to only Ground. However, this one weakness leaves Stunky vulnerable to Pokemon like Diglett, Mudbray, and Drilbur, which are very common. Unfortunately for Stunky, its abilities are mediocre at best; Stench doesn't really help Stunky do its job at all, and Aftermath is rarely useful. Stunky also struggles offensively because it lacks physical coverage options, and it typically has a hard time doing anything aside from Pursuit trapping and removing hazards. Stunky's complete lack of recovery leaves it prone to being worn down over the course of the battle. Alolan Grimer is almost always a better Pursuit trapper due to its better bulk and access to Knock Off.", "Thundurus": "Thundurus acts as niche wallbreaker in the tier thanks to its great Special Attack, colorful coverage, and access to a potent boosting option in Nasty Plot, allowing it to break through metagame staples like Ferrothorn, Toxapex, Tornadus-T, and Celesteela. Thundurus also has a respectable Speed stat, letting it outpace common Pokemon in Garchomp, Kartana, and Mega Latios, and an Electric / Flying typing gives it some useful defensive merits such as an immunity to Earthquake and a resistance to Grass and Flying; these notably allow it to stay in on bulky Grass-types like specially defensive Tapu Bulu and Tangrowth and means it can check Pokemon like Tornadus-T and Kartana. However, Thundurus's mediocre bulk and weakness to Stealth Rock mean it can't do this very reliably. Though Thundurus has overall good coverage, it struggles to break through Grass-types like Amoonguss and Mega Venusaur as well as Calm Mind Mega Latias thanks to its best attack for them being the weak Hidden Power Ice, which they negate with their abilities or stat boosts. Unfortunately, despite its good typing and decent Speed tier, Thundurus is very prone to being revenge killed, either by faster Pokemon like Ash-Greninja, Mega Alakazam, and Tapu Koko or by priority from the likes of Mega Mawile and Mega Medicham.", "Chespin": "Chespin is a pretty weak Pokemon overall, but it has a few niches that allow it to remain usable in the current metagame. Chespin's ability, Bulletproof, allows it to counter several prominent Pokemon in LC like Foongus and Gastly that do not use Will-O-Wisp and Hex. Chespin can also set up Spikes while simultaneously having consistent recovery in Synthesis. In addition, it is able to check Ground-types like Drilbur and non-RestTalk Mudbray. Chespin's mono-Grass typing, however, makes it weak to both Flying- and Fire-types like Doduo, Rufflet, and Ponyta without being able to damage them very much. It also faces competition from other Spikes setters like Omanyte and Ferroseed, since they can set other entry hazards in addition to Spikes. Chespin is also very mediocre stat-wise, and it faces competition both offensively and defensively from Pokemon like Pumpkaboo-XL, Ferroseed, and Foongus. Finally, Chespin's Speed is fairly low, which affects its ability to put offensive pressure on the opponent.", "Pancham": "Pancham's access to Parting Shot in combination with its solid bulk and great Attack turns it into an excellent pivot capable of easily giving setup sweepers a free switch. Its wide movepool also includes Swords Dance, which can potentially turn it into a powerful wallbreaker or, with Sticky Web support, even a sweeper, and good coverage options such as Gunk Shot and Zen Headbutt, setting it apart from other Fighting-types.", "Spritzee": "Spritzee has a solid place in the metagame thanks to its good bulk and fantastic Fairy typing, allowing it to check the ever-present Fighting- and Dark-type moves that dominate the LC metagame. Additionally, Spritzee has fantastic defensive synergy with other prominent defensive Pokemon in the metagame, allowing it to form backbones to support defensive, balanced, and bulky offensive teams. Spritzee also has access to Wish, giving it both a semi-reliable form of recovery and the ability to support its team. Coupled with Aromatherapy, Wish helps Spritzee become the best cleric in the LC metagame. Spritzee can even act as a late-game wincon with access to Calm Mind. Its ability Aroma Veil doesn't hurt either, giving it an immunity to moves that would typically take down defensive Pokemon, including Taunt and Encore.", "Sableye": "Sableye is a well-rounded defensive Pokemon in the PU metagame thanks to its good typing, solid utility, and access to Prankster. Sableye's Ghost / Dark typing not only gives it good immunities to a lot of moves while leaving it only weak to Fairy but also makes it a capable spinblocker. Prankster gives Sableye's status moves priority, which is a nuisance for the majority of the tier, as priority Taunt and Will-O-Wisp can really mess with a lot of Pokemon that want to set up, heal, or simply attack. Access to priority Recover also makes Sableye a durable and consistent wall. Unfortunately, poor base stats make Sableye fairly vulnerable to strong wallbreakers. It also means Sableye is reliant on Will-O-Wisp to check a lot of physical threats, even with physical bulk investment. Additionally, status moves affected by Prankster have no effect on opposing Dark-type Pokemon, so they usually can switch into Sableye freely and pressure it out. Finally, Sableye is vulnerable to strong special attackers especially when uninvested, which means it does still require some support to function effectively.", "Seviper": "In theory, Seviper seems like a functional breaker with its decent mixed attacking stats and movepool. In reality though, it struggles much more than one would think due to lacking bulk, an average Speed tier, and a reliance on Sucker Punch without STAB to hit faster threats, leaving it open to offensive pressure from the likes of Stoutland and Pinsir. It also receives some competition from fellow Poison-types in Skuntank, Haunter, and Victreebel, as they have additional utility such as Defog, Destiny Bond, and Strength Sap, respectively, and they all sport better Speed tiers and a secondary typing.", "Dugtrio": null, "Typhlosion": "Although Typhlosion has access to Eruption, passable coverage, and a solid Speed tier, it falls short as a wallbreaker due to it failing to reliably break bulky Water-types like Vaporeon and Slowking as well as other Fire-resistant Pokemon such as Hariyama and Druddigon. Additionally, Typhlosion faces immense competition as a Fire-type from Magmortar and Delphox. Magmortar is a better wallbreaker due to its greater Special Attack and coverage options, while Delphox is much more versatile, being able to employ multiple sets effectively. Do not ever use this Pokemon with the intent of winning games.", "Golurk": "Golurk carves a niche in the PU tier due to its offensive typing and immunity to Rapid Spin and Volt Switch. Golurk's typing also allows it to block Normal-, Fighting-, and Electric-type attacks from common threats such as Type: Null, Primeape, and Alolan Raichu. Golurk sports high Attack, and its array of coverage moves such as Shadow Punch, Drain Punch, and Ice Punch get boosted by Iron Fist. What separates Golurk from other Stealth Rock users is its offensive prowess as well as its typing and ability to pressure other common entry hazard and Defog users such as Ferroseed, Regirock, Skuntank, and Swanna. Despite its offensive prowess, Golurk struggles to break through bulky walls such as Gastrodon and Weezing. Along with this setback, Golurk's mediocre Speed stat leaves it outsped by common threats such as Swanna and Floatzel. Additionally, being weak to common types such as Ice, Grass, and Water makes revenge killing and forcing out Golurk much easier.", "Volcanion": "Volcanion makes for an interesting pick in the UU metagame with its unique typing, movepool, and stat distribution enabling a variety of viable sets and approaches. Given its high Special Attack, plethora of coverage options, and signature move Steam Eruption, Volcanion is most commonly used as a wallbreaker with Choice Specs. Additionally, its solid defensive typing, overall bulk, and useful ability in Water Absorb allow it to serve as a respectable offensive check to Pokemon like Scizor, Mega Altaria, and Primarina and even let it run bulkier sets featuring Toxic. However, Volcanion has difficulty in dealing with the tier's omnipresent Dragon-types in Latias and Hydreigon. Its middling Speed tier and weaknesses to common attacking types in Rock, Ground, and Electric also open up opportunities for some of the tier's most potent wallbreakers in Terrakion and Nidoking to do big damage and for Pokemon like Mega Manectric and Rotom-C to gain momentum with Volt Switch. Lastly, Volcanion is vulnerable to all entry hazards, most importantly Stealth Rock, hurting its overall longevity and defensive utility if they are not cleared accordingly.", "Dwebble": "Dwebble can set entry hazards very well and is a decent Shell Smash user. Weak Armor allows Dwebble to move before any opposing Pokemon after taking a physical hit, making it possible to set up an extra layer of hazards or remove a foe's item while still posing a threat due to its high Speed. Dwebble's other ability in Sturdy is incredibly good along with Berry Juice, and it allows Dwebble to be useful in every game. This combination also allows Dwebble to set up Shell Smash more consistently. While Dwebble faces competition from Pokemon like Shellder as a Shell Smash user and Ferroseed and Onix as a general utility Pokemon and Stealth Rock setter, Dwebble is able to find a niche through its unique coverage, ability to lay multiple hazards, and combination of Sturdy, Shell Smash, and Berry Juice. Dwebble does have some faults, though: it is fairly bad against Pokemon like Onix and Mienfoo, which can outspeed it and shut it down with Taunt, and it does very poorly against most other hazard setters and removers, like Onix and Staryu. Dwebble does not function very well as a check to Flying-types because it does not resist their STAB moves, making it function much less effectively than Pokemon like Onix, which is both a hazard setter and a good Flying-type check. In addition, Dwebble does not have a good defensive typing, as it is weak to Stealth Rock. Dwebble also struggles against and typically loses to Fighting-types, which is bad because they are very common. Finally, Dwebble is weak to the priority move Aqua Jet from Pokemon like Tirtouga and Corphish.", "Scizor": "Mega Scizor possesses an outstanding defensive typing in Bug / Steel, great defensive stats, and Roost to keep itself healthy, which let it handle titans like Landorus-T, Kartana, Tapu Bulu, and Mamoswine. Mega Scizor holds excellent utility thanks to its access to moves like Bullet Punch and Knock Off. Access to a STAB priority move in Bullet Punch, which is also boosted by Technician, lets Mega Scizor threaten a variety of Pokemon like Tapu Bulu, Kyurem-B, and Mega Diancie. Mega Scizor also has access to Swords Dance, which can let it sweep or clean up late-game. Although Mega Scizor may be capable of beating Kartana, Tapu Bulu, and Mamoswine on their own, they're often paired with Magnezone, which can trap and remove Mega Scizor from the match if not played around cautiously. While Mega Scizor's typing is very strong defensively, it also comes with a downside: it is very susceptible to the decently common Fire-types, and Pokemon that Mega Scizor is supposed to check, such as Kyurem-B and Mega Diancie, often run Fire-type coverage to beat it.", "Persian": "Although Persian is faster than most of the unboosted metagame and has access to Nasty Plot and Technician, it is unfortunately a terrible Pokemon. None of its stats are particularly good outside of its Speed, which means it won't hit very hard, can't easily set up, and is easy to revenge kill with priority moves and Choice Scarf users. Persian is outclassed as a specially offensive Normal-type by Drampa, which hits much harder without even needing to set up and also has a secondary Dragon typing. Persian is also outclassed as a Nasty Plot sweeper by Alolan Raichu and Alolan Persian, with the former having a higher Special Attack stat and using its secondary Psychic typing to threaten Pokemon like Hitmonchan and Roselia, while the latter's access to Fur Coat provides it with actual defensive presence and makes setting up much easier.", "Nidoking": "Nidoking's amazing offensive typing combined with its ability Sheer Force turns it into a very powerful wallbreaker in the UnderUsed tier. Between its STAB moves and Ice Beam, Nidoking is able to hit the majority of the tier super effectively, meaning it has a very flexible last moveslot for another option such as Substitute or Taunt. By virtue of its typing, Nidoking is able to check Pokemon like Tentacruel and Primarina offensively and switch into Pokemon like Klefki and Zeraora with ease. Furthermore, Nidoking sets itself apart from its counterpart, Nidoqueen, thanks to its better Speed tier and better overall offensive capabilities. However, its average Speed tier makes it slower than Pokemon like Latias, Hydreigon, and Krookodile, meaning it can be easily revenge killed. It's also held back by its weakness to common typings in Ground, Psychic, Water, and Ice, making it easily exploitable by Pokemon like Krookodile, Latias, Starmie, and Kyurem. Nidoking's mediocre bulk also makes it hard for it to find opportunities to switch in.", "Zapdos": "Wonderful typing, reliable recovery, and a solid base stat total make Zapdos a solid defensive OU threat. Zapdos's niche is how hard it is to deal with for many offensive teams; staples to this archetype such as Supersonic Skystrike Landorus-T, Tornadus-T, Mega Scizor, Hawlucha, Mega Lopunny, and Serperior struggle to get past it, and with Zapdos's coverage, it's quite difficult to switch into for these teams. Its weakness to Stealth Rock does limit it, though, forcing it to use Roost excessively or simply rendering it unable to counter what it ought to for the duration of the match. Zapdos is a decent Defogger, however its weakness to Stealth Rock and its poor matchup versus a number of prominent hazard setters in the tier like Heatran and Mega Tyranitar mean it can struggle at times.", "Ninjask": "Ninjask is able to distinguish itself by being the fastest unboosted Pokemon in the metagame. Its stellar Speed stat allows it to revenge kill some of the fastest Pokemon in the tier, such as Floatzel, Alolan Raichu, and Jynx, with a little prior damage. With Tectonic Rage, Ninjask is able to overpower foes such as Regirock and Aggron. These traits give Ninjask a decent amount of staying power against offensive and balanced builds. However, Ninjask's offensive presence only goes so far because its mediocre bulk, nasty 4x Stealth Rock weakness, and five common weaknesses to Fire-, Flying-, Ice-, Rock-, and Electric-type attacks mean it is revenge killed rather easily. Furthermore, Ninjask is often an inconsistent revenge killer due to its mediocre Attack stat, and it is left vulnerable to strong priority users such as Lycanroc, Kangaskhan, Abomasnow, and Absol. Ninjask's rather average Attack stat also means that it struggles to break Pokemon such as Weezing, which are able to sponge Ninjask's unboosted attacks and deal good damage in return.", "Charmander": "Charmander might look like a good Pokemon to use due to its movepool and access to Dragon Dance, but its power output is disappointing even with using Life Orb to get the most out of its attacks. It is outclassed by other Fire-types like Ponyta, Larvesta, and Magby due to their better Attack, Speed, and bulk.", "Shiinotic": "While Shiinotic has an interesting typing, usable bulk, Strength Sap, and Spore, it is fairly passive, is weak to status, and is very slow. Shiinotic is also outclassed by various other defensive Pokemon with similar typings such as Tangela, Lurantis, Roselia, and Clefairy. Tangela has superior physical bulk, Knock Off, and Regenerator, Lurantis has access to Defog and Contrary, and Roselia can set Spikes, Toxic Spikes, and heal off status with Natural Cure. Clefairy also packs status and entry hazard immunity, as well as Stealth Rock.", "Karrablast": "Karrablast has an interesting niche in the LC metagame due to its great Attack, a great ability in No Guard, and the highly powerful Megahorn, which make it a powerful physical attacker that never misses. Karrablast's moderate defenses grant it at least enough bulk to tank most priority and weak neutral attacks, although it is let down by its Bug typing, which has many weaknesses, especially to Stealth Rock, making it easy to target. Karrablast's coverage moves aren't good either, as they are underwhelming and weak, leaving it only with its Bug-type STAB move to deal damage, which isn't really good offensively either.", "Furfrou": "Forced to compete with other physical Normal-types such as Stoutland, Kangaskhan, and Dodrio, Furfrou is relegated to a more defensive role that capitalizes on Fur Coat, its access to U-turn, and its above average Speed tier. However, for Furfrou to also not be overly passive and be solely outclassed by Alolan Persian, it must invest into its Attack stat to try to mesh the two roles together. Furfrou unfortunately succeeds at neither. Furfrou also doesn't have that great of an offensive nor a support movepool, acting as the final nail in the coffin.", "Nincada": "Nincada is a poor choice for Little Cup due to bad stats, an absolutely horrible movepool that can't hurt most foes, and a bad typing. Because of this, Nincada is outclassed by other Ground-types such as Onix and Mudbray that both offer more utility and power for any prospective team.", "Grumpig": "Grumpig could seem viable at first glance seeing as it has Thick Fat, a good Special Defense stat, and a decent enough movepool but falls flat in practice due to not being able hit hard, having no recovery, and being weak to physical attacks. Grumpig is also outclassed by other Psychic types that completely outclass Grumpig outside of Thick Fat such as Mesprit, which has way better offensive stats, and Musharna, which has good defensive stats and reliable recovery. Grumpig is also very weak to Pursuit, which stops it from running any defensive moveset.", "Moltres": "Moltres fits incredibly well in the tier and has the ability to fulfill roles nothing else can. Moltres's stats are solid by UU standards, and its typing is a mixed blessing: Fire / Flying provides fantastic offensive coverage, resistances to important types, such as Bug, Steel, Fighting, and Fire, and an immunity to Ground-type moves. However, Moltres is weak to Water-, Electric- and Rock-type moves, with the latter also bringing a 4x weakness to Stealth Rock, which is a significant inconvenience but is manageable thanks to the good availability of Defog users. Moltres's abilities also are rather niche, its movepool is somewhat limited, and it can be very one-dimensional and predictable, but despite this, it has all the tools it needs to be a major threat in the UU tier.", "Flareon": "Flareon might look good to use based on its excellent Attack and good Special Defense stats. However, its horrid Speed and shallow movepool make it hard to use. Furthermore, it has no defensive utility outside of Flash Fire due to its bad defensive typing, vulnerability to hazards, and inability to switch into unresisted attacks. Flareon is one of the few Fire-types in the tier, as well as one of the fewer physical Fire-types, which gives it a small niche; however, it struggles to be a good wallbreaker due to its low Speed stat and the recoil from Flare Blitz. It is outclassed by other wallbreakers like Combusken, Stoutland, and Dodrio due to their better Speed stats and movepools.", "Crabrawler": "Crabrawler is able to beat Pokemon that give Fighting-types trouble, such as Mudbray and Mareanie, thanks to its impressive coverage. Its decent Attack and Speed stats make it a good wallbreaker or late-game cleaner, and its passable bulk allows it to take resisted hits well. Its ability Hyper Cutter provides some use in not weakening the power of Crabrawler's moves. However, Crabrawler's bulk is not the best, and Iron Fist, usually an ideal ability for physical Fighting-types, is completely useless on it, as it does not have access to a good punch-based move. Furthermore, Crabrawler faces competition from other bulky attackers such as Mienfoo, Croagunk, and Timburr, as well as Mankey, which has a useful ability and access to Gunk Shot. It also does not have access to Knock Off, resulting it with a poor matchup against Psychic- and Ghost-types and meaning that Crabrawler requires a lot of support to help against them. Finally, it lacks semi-reliable recovery in Drain Punch, which a lot of Fighting-types have.", "Kabuto": "Kabuto has a niche in being a Rapid Spin user that can also set up Stealth Rock, allowing it to perform two major roles in a team. Kabuto also has access to Knock Off, which allows it to remove foes' Eviolites and hit the Ghost-types that try and block Rapid Spin. Its useful Water typing allows it to beat many common leads like Onix and Dwebble, as well as giving it resistances to common types like Fire, Poison, and Flying. With a solid Defense stat and Rock typing, Kabuto becomes a decent Flying-type check; while it is weak to Fighting, Kabuto survives a Jump Kick from Doduo, a Superpower from Bulk Up Rufflet, and two Knock Offs from Vullaby while OHKOing Doduo and Rufflet and 2HKOing Vullaby with Rock Slide. Kabuto has a good Attack stat that allows it to beat Drilbur and Life Orb Diglett with Waterfall. After it is activated, Weak Armor allows Kabuto to outspeed Pokemon such as Doduo and Rufflet. Despite its good defensive prowess, its special bulk is lackluster, making it lose to many mixed and special attackers like Staryu, Foongus, and Spritzee. While it is a decent Flying-type check, a poor defensive typing also gives it weaknesses to common Fighting-, Electric-, and Grass-type moves. Kabuto also faces competition from other Rapid Spin users such as Staryu and Drilbur and other Stealth Rock setters such as Dwebble and Onix, which have better Speed stats, offensive presences, and defensive typings.", "Turtwig": "Turtwig brings an interesting niche to the table as the only pure Grass-type that can set Stealth Rock; this, coupled with other decent attributes such as a decent movepool, defensive stats, and typing, allows Turtwig to be an adequate entry hazard setter. Aside from a great recovery option in Synthesis, Turtwig has access to two other good moves in Bullet Seed for STAB damage against Pokemon such as Staryu and Drilbur, which also happen to be common Rapid Spin users, and Superpower for coverage against Pokemon such as Magnemite and Pawniard. However, while it has a good matchup against most spinners, Turtwig falls short to other common metagame threats such as Ponyta and Vullaby. Turtwig is outclassed by Ferroseed as a Grass-type entry hazard setter and by Onix as a Stealth Rock setter due to their more useful abilities and better stats. Turtwig is also relatively passive due to its limited offensive options, moderate stats, and the drawbacks of Superpower. The biggest reason why Turtwig isn't used much is because there are better Stealth Rock setters such as the aforementioned Onix, while as a Water-type check, Grass-types such as Snivy are more reliable.", "Chatot": "Chatot's poor defensive stats, weakness to Stealth Rock, and middling Speed tier allow it to be easily revenge killed. Additionally, Chatot is reliant on Boomburst to deal significant damage, leaving it completely walled by most Ghost-types such as Jellicent. Chatot is also outclassed as a Choice Scarf user by Pokemon such as Dodrio and as a wallbreaker by Pokemon such as Drampa.", "Fraxure": null, "Stantler": "There's no reason to use Stantler over other Normal-types, particularly Dodrio and Stoutland. Intimidate is nice, and it does have some decent coverage and priority options, but its lack of bulk, Speed or even decent power means it fails to carve a niche for itself in PU.", "Shinx": "Shinx has a unique niche as an Intimidate user that can check physical Flying-types and pivot in and out safely thanks to Volt Switch; however, it is hard to justify its use due to its poor defensive stats and bad coverage. Even with Intimidate, Shinx's bulk is very underwhelming, which means it can't reliably check threats such as Doduo and Rufflet. It is outclassed by Snubbull as an Intimidate pivot because of Snubbull's better overall stats, and stronger coverage options, and it is outclassed by Chinchou as an Electric-type defensive pivot thanks to Chinchou's better bulk and defensive typing.", "Zubat": null, "Rockruff": "Rockruff has underwhelming offensive stats and a disappointing movepool. Rockruff is also extremely frail, which leaves it easily revenge killed by Choice Scarf users or priority moves such as Mach Punch and Aqua Jet. Other offensive Rock-types such as Cranidos, which is much more powerful with useful abilities and a better movepool, and even Tirtouga, which has access to better coverage moves and the ability to boost its stats with Shell Smash, greatly outclass Rockruff.", "Glameow": "Despite its high Speed and access to Play Rough, Glameow finds itself outclassed by other fast offensive Normal-types like Bunnelby, Taillow, and Meowth. Glameow simply is not as powerful as its competition, and its paltry bulk means if it doesn't OHKO the opposing Pokemon it is likely taking huge damage. There is very little that can justify running it in favor of other more consistent, powerful, and versatile Normal-type cleaners.", "Helioptile": "While Helioptile may look appealing due to its ability Dry Skin, its poor bulk makes it unable to take attacks without being heavily damaged. One thing that Helioptile has going for it is access to Glare, which can paralyze Ground-types, and U-turn, which allows it to avoid getting trapped by Diglett. However, Helioptile's advantages are not enough to make up for its shortcomings, as other Electric-type Pokemon like Chinchou and Magnemite both outclass this Pokemon due to a better Special Attack stat, better defensive typing, and better bulk. Elekid can also perform Helioptile's offensive role better due to its higher Special Attack stat and its better Speed.", "Charizard": "Mega Charizard X is an extremely strong wallbreaker and setup sweeper that can offensively pressure key Steel- and Grass-types such as Magearna, Ferrothorn, and Tangrowth. Its great offensive typing after Mega Evolving and strong STAB options boosted by Tough Claws allow it to break past most of the metagame with near-unresisted STAB and coverage options. Mega Charizard X's good Speed tier enables it to outpace fast foes such as Tapu Lele, Kyurem-B, and Gliscor, giving it the edge over other slower wallbreakers. Access to Dragon Dance makes Mega Charizard X extremely threatening after a boost, outspeeding even some Choice Scarf users like Landorus-T. However, it is extremely susceptible to entry hazards; before Charizard Mega Evolves, it is 4x weak to Stealth Rock and struggles to effectively switch in, and after Mega Evolving it becomes vulnerable to all forms of entry hazards. Furthermore, it is also chipped down by residual damage like Rocky Helmet from Tornadus-T and Iron Barbs from Ferrothorn as well as taking substantial Flare Blitz recoil to deal with these foes, which limits its ability to break these Pokemon without being worn down into range of faster attackers or priority itself.", "Cutiefly": null, "Minccino": "Minccino is a potent threat capable of breaking through weakened foes. Due to the way LC damage rolls work, the combination of Tail Slap and Skill Link allows it to do a lot of damage. An excellent Speed tier of 18 also allows it to outspeed Mienfoo, Vullaby, and Onix. However, it is outsped by Abra and Ponyta and only Speed ties with Gastly. Its Normal typing is unremarkable other than its weakness to the common Fighting-types that dominate LC. Furthermore, its poor defensive stats allow it to be OHKOed by a wide variety of foes, such as Abra and Mienfoo. Lastly, while it has a good range of coverage options, such as Knock Off and Seed Bomb, its low Attack stat means that other than Tail Slap, its moves are relatively weak.", "Tropius": "Tropius attempts to stall opposing Pokemon with Substitute and Leech Seed. However, Tropius faces a lot of competition from Tangela as a defensive Grass-type, as Tangela is much more bulky thanks to Eviolite, gets more reliable recovery in Regenerator, and possesses a nice matchup against physically offensive Pokemon in the tier such as Stoutland and Lycanroc. Tropius struggles against the latter especially due to its Grass / Flying typing, which gives it a Stealth Rock weakness which heavily reduces its longevity. Low Speed hinders Tropius as well and makes even harder to set up Substitute since offensive Pokemon like Lycanroc and Aurorus are able to outspeed it and force it out.", "Horsea": "Horsea can be a threat under rain, but that is where the problem lies. Because manual weather is so bad and it has terrible bulk, Horsea finds itself unable to set up Rain Dance. When it does manage to use Rain Dance, it is forced onto a time limit because of the short duration of manual rain. Furthermore, Horsea is outclassed by other Swift Swim users such as Omanyte, as they can hit much harder than Horsea in the rain. Other offensive Water-types like Corphish outclass it as well because of having better bulk and raw power. Without rain being active, Horsea finds itself slower than a lot of the tier's most common offensive Pokemon.", "Petilil": "It's hard to find much use for Petilil in the Little Cup metagame. It's slow and not very bulky, and aside from access to Sleep Powder and niche options like Healing Wish is completely outclassed by fellow offensive Grass-type Snivy, which has a great ability in Contrary, much better Speed, and nice utility moves like Defog and Knock Off. The closest thing Petilil has to a niche is that of a self-setting sun sweeper due to the power of Solar Beam coupled with a good Special Attack stat, but such a niche is rather subpar seeing as setting up Sunny Day leaves Petilil vulnerable for a whole turn, which is especially bad for a Pokemon with the aforementioned issues of poor bulk and Speed. Even in this role, it's outclassed by Bulbasaur, Bellsprout, and even Oddish, which have better typings that make setting up easier, in addition to better bulk, power, Speed, or coverage.", "Luxray": "Luxray faces some broad competition against offensive Electric-types like Eelektross and Manectric along with other physical wallbreakers due to their far superior speed, utility, and power. While it does have some good attributes like a solid Attack stat and abilities, Luxray\u2019s flaws outweigh the positives, as it is very frail and sits at a poor Speed tier. It doesn\u2019t help Luxray either that its primary attack, Wild Charge, massively cripples its longevity.", "Lotad": "Lotad differentiates itself from other Swift Swim users with its perfect neutral coverage and key neutralities to Electric- and Grass-type attacks. However, with such abysmal stats across the board, Lotad is still a dysfunctional Swift Swim abuser, facing fierce competition for teamslots from Pokemon such as Omanyte and Mantyke. Furthermore, rain hyper offensive playstyles are exceedingly rare, making it even harder for Lotad to find its way onto teams. Lastly, Lotad is picked off easily by priority attackers such as Timburr due to its lack of Eviolite and terrible bulk. Lotad is also exceedingly slow, outsped by Choice Scarf users such as Pawniard even under rain.", "Mienshao": "Mienshao is a good fast pivot due to its access to U-turn and Knock Off in conjunction with Regenerator and an Assault Vest, allowing it to constantly pivot in and chip foes throughout a game. Furthermore, its high Speed lets it outspeed metagame staples such as Hydreigon, Celebi, and Nihilego, which greatly bolsters its ability as a pivot, and its pure Fighting typing enables Mienshao to check some of the tier's key threats in Hydreigon and Kyurem. Mienshao can also switch into other special attackers more easily due to its resistance to Stealth Rock and its increased special bulk from an Assault Vest. However, its typing also leaves it vulnerable to several key attacking types in Fairy, Flying, and Psychic, and it struggles with foes such as Mega Altaria, Moltres, and Latias as a result. While Mienshao may be able to switch into some special attacks due to its Assault Vest, it has minimal physical bulk, which makes it vulnerable to priority moves from Scizor, Mamoswine, and Crawdaunt and faster physical attackers like Terrakion and Zeraora.", "Honedge": "Honedge's Steel / Ghost typing, good Attack stat, and access to STAB priority allow it to function as a decent offensive check to Fairy- and Psychic-types like Spritzee and Abra. It can also soft check Flying-types like Doduo and Rufflet, though it fears Knock Off from the former. Honedge also has a good movepool, which includes coverage options in Sacred Sword and Rock Slide to complement its STAB moves, Pursuit to trap and KO Abra while being immune to Counter from Focus Sash variants, and Swords Dance to boost its already good Attack stat. However, Honedge's typing is a double-edged sword, as it leaves it weak to common moves such as Knock Off and Earthquake. In addition, these moves are often run as coverage by Pokemon it would otherwise be able to check, such as Fighting-types like Mienfoo and Rock-types like Dwebble. Honedge also lacks any form of recovery outside of Berry Juice, which in combination with its bad Special Defense, leaves it open to being worn down, and its STAB moves have low Base Power and only average coverage, meaning that despite its good Attack stat, it's unable to deal significant damage to a big portion of the metagame. Lastly, Honedge faces a lot of competition from other Steel-types like Ferroseed, which has access to Stealth Rock, Spikes, and Thunder Wave, as well as Pursuit trappers like Alolan Grimer, which has a more powerful Pursuit thanks to it being STAB, access to STAB Knock Off, and a great ability in Poison Touch.", "Sentret": null, "Snover": "Snover is one of the best hail setters due to its ability Snow Warning automatically setting it upon switching in. Alongside the hail support it provides, it has a good synergy with Alolan Sandshrew, which benefits from the hail. Snover also has access to powerful moves such as Blizzard, which has perfect accuracy in hail and can do massive damage; Giga Drain, which does reasonable STAB damage and provides a form of recovery; and Ice Shard, which can clean off weakened Pokemon. With a Choice Scarf, Snover can outspeed almost all of the unboosted metagame and take out a variety of different Pokemon such as Water-, Ground-, and Flying-types. Snover's Grass / Ice typing leaves it very weak to the common Fighting-type Pokemon and Stealth Rock and the majority of its setters. Snover also faces competition from the two other hail setters, Alolan Vulpix and Amaura, which can set up Aurora Veil and Stealth Rock, respectively. However, Snover differences itself from the other two hail setters due to being able to recover health with Giga Drain, and it can also clean weakened Pokemon with priority moves as well, which are traits that Amaura and Alolan Vulpix don't have. Snover may have Hidden Power Ground, but it mostly cannot KO its checks in a one-on-one situation unless it hits them on an expected switch, so it lacks reliable coverage.", "Gogoat": "Gogoat faces major competition from other defensive Grass-types in the metagame such as Tangela and Roselia. Gogoat suffers from four-moveslot syndrome, leaving it unable to hit Poison-types such as Skuntank and Muk if it chooses to run Rock Slide or unable to pressure Flying- and Bug-type Pokemon such as Dodrio, Oricorio-G, and Scyther if it chooses to run Earthquake. Additionally, Gogoat is somewhat weak without boosts and is very slow, leaving it vulnerable to status moves and revenge killers.", "Flygon": "Flygon is one of the most threatening Pokemon in the RU metagame, able to perform as a setup sweeper, pivot, and revenge killer. It finds a lot of opportunities to set up Dragon Dance due to its ability to force out Rock-, Ground-, and Steel-types like Gigalith, Doublade, and Nidoqueen. It also has an extensive movepool with attacks like Earthquake, Outrage, Iron Tail, U-turn, and Fire Punch, allowing it to threaten a myriad of Pokemon. Thanks to its typing and ability, Flygon possesses a handful of notable resistances, such as to Fire and Rock, and immunities to Electric and Ground; this also means it is very resilient to entry hazards. Despite its excellent typing, Flygon has very average bulk, which means it can struggle to switch into resisted attacks often. Flygon's also rather average Attack stat means that it can be pressured by Pokemon that it should beat like Doublade and Escavalier, which can take an unboosted attack really well and deal considerable damage to Flygon, making it easier to revenge kill later in the match. Lastly, Flygon has a really nasty Ice weakness, meaning it has to be wary of Pokemon like Sneasel and Mega Glalie, and it is also prone to being lured by Pokemon that can run Ice-type moves like Salazzle and Rhyperior.", "Escavalier": "Escavalier is one of the best glue Pokemon in the tier, as its defensive typing and solid bulk allow it to check many common threats. Its powerful STAB moves backed by a monstrous Attack stat make it hard to switch into, and an excellent defensive typing gives it a wide range of resistances and only one weakness. Access to Pursuit allows it to damage foes that attempt to flee from it, including threats such as Swellow and Shaymin. However, sluggish base 20 Speed leaves it outpaced by almost the entire tier and often means it has to take two hits before retaliating when switching in. A massive 4x weakness to Fire causes it to be lured easily by Pokemon that it would otherwise wall and are using Fire-type coverage. No reliable recovery and susceptibility to all entry hazards also lead it to being worn down quickly.", "Sliggoo": null, "Marshadow": null, "Houndoom": "The notable Special Attack and Speed boosts Houndoom receives upon Mega Evolution make it a respectable sweeper in the UU metagame. Its movepool complements its massive Special Attack stat and strong offensive typing perfectly, containing high-Base Power STAB moves, a great boosting move in Nasty Plot, and other intriguing options such as Sludge Bomb, Taunt, and Destiny Bond. With its high Speed, Mega Houndoom outspeeds much of the unboosted tier, notably including Pokemon like Cobalion, Latias, and Gengar. However, while its Dark / Fire typing is solid offensively, it leaves Mega Houndoom weak to the tier's common Water-, Fighting-, and Ground-type attacks. Mega Houndoom also finds itself vulnerable to all entry hazards, including a notable weakness to Stealth Rock, which in combination with its average bulk does not leave Mega Houndoom with many opportunities to fulfill its role. It also has some rough one-on-one matchups with top-tier Pokemon like Hydreigon and Mega Aerodactyl, putting more pressure on the rest of the team to shore up those recurring weaknesses.", "Kartana": "Kartana is one of the most threatening Pokemon in the USM metagame due to it having insanely high Attack and superb Speed, making Kartana incredibly hard to counter defensively. Unfortunately, low base HP and pitiful Special Defense make Kartana one of the most specially frail Pokemon in the tier. It is able to salvage its decent physical bulk thanks to a high Defense stat, however. Its Grass / Steel typing also assists Kartana defensively, as it resists many different types and only has two weaknesses, Fighting and Fire. Offensively, Kartana's typing is also appreciated, especially alongside the coverage move Sacred Sword. Finally, Beast Boost allows Kartana to boost its Attack every time it gets a KO and makes consistent defensive counterplay incredibly hard to come by.", "Landorus": null, "Zigzagoon": "In Little Cup, Zigzagoon can act as an effective physical sweeper thanks to its access to the amazing combination of Belly Drum to maximize its Attack in an instant and Extreme Speed to outprioritize its foes and KO them. Unfortunately, it is hindered by its numerous flaws such as its poor bulk, which makes it struggle to set up Belly Drum reliably. Zigzagoon also requires excessive team support to perform its role with success, and without this, many Pokemon are able to get in the way of its sweep. In most games, Zigzagoon tends to either win the battle for its team with a successful sweep or fail to contribute anything at all.", "Lugia": null, "Onix": "Onix is arguably the best Stealth Rock user in Little Cup, and for very good reason. Its ability Sturdy essentially guarantees that it sets up Stealth Rock and helps give it multiple chances to do so. It also has the highest Defense stat in the tier by far, although it struggles to utilize it due to its abysmal defensive typing that gives it many weaknesses and a vulnerability to entry hazards, which can cripple it extremely.", "Clefairy": "As a result of Clefairy\u2019s solid Eviolite-augmented bulk and access to reliable recovery in Soft-Boiled, Clefairy is capable of functioning as an effective check to some of PU's most threatening special attackers, such as Drampa and Aurorus. Clefairy also has access to a stellar defensive ability in Magic Guard, which blocks all forms of passive damage, making it immune to Spikes and allowing it to act as a status absorber, which is particularly useful for Calm Mind sets. On top of this, Clefairy boasts an amazing support movepool, with moves such as Knock Off, Stealth Rock, and Thunder Wave in its arsenal, making Clefairy one of few Pokemon in the tier to have both Stealth Rock and recovery. Unfortunately, Clefairy is heavily reliant on its Eviolite to check stronger special attackers due to its otherwise below-average bulk, making it vulnerable to Knock Off and thus shaky as a Dark-type check. Even with its Eviolite intact, Clefairy struggles against strong physical attackers such as Stoutland and Aggron as a result of its poor physical bulk. Finally, Clefairy suffers from being passive, meaning that it fits best on bulkier, more defensive teams.", "Grimer": "Even though Grimer's Poison typing and Sticky Hold ability let it switch in on Fighting-types, as it resists their STAB attacks and does not risk losing its item, Trubbish does the same thing but better because of its higher Speed, access to entry hazards in Spikes, and repeated Berry Juice recovery with Recycle. Other bulky Poison-types like Foongus and Mareanie use their secondary typings to not completely fall flat to Diglett and to pivot effectively with Regenerator, respectively. Lastly, Alolan Grimer completely overshadows Grimer as a bulky Poison-type because of its Poison / Dark typing, granting only one weakness and having exclusive access to moves like Knock Off and Pursuit to effectively trap Abra and Gastly.", "Bagon": "Bagon finds itself heavily outclassed in the Little Cup metagame by other, more reliable setup sweepers such as Shellder, Tyrunt, and Timburr. Bagon is incredibly frail and takes considerable damage even from neutral attacks, making it difficult for Bagon to safely set up with Dragon Dance. Finally, Bagon lacks any super effective coverage moves or a secondary STAB option to hit Fairy-types such as Spritzee, allowing them to completely trample over it.", "Magneton": "Magneton's niche lies in its access to Magnet Pull, which allows it to trap and revenge kill the omnipresent Scizor. It can also reliably trap and remove key Steel-types in Klefki and Empoleon, which can open the door for teammates like Latias, Mega Altaria, and Nihilego to more easily sweep. Outside of trapping Steel-types, Magneton has decent offensive presence thanks to its high Special Attack, decent dual STAB coverage, and access to STAB Volt Switch. It can also utilize its decent defensive typing to pivot in on passive attackers like Florges and Klefki if need be. Unfortunately, Magneton's niche is often offset by its pitiful bulk, which mostly prevents it from taking advantage of its useful resistances or reliably coming into play. This can complicate its ability to trap Scizor due to its fear of directly switching in, often requiring that it accomplish its role with support from a pivoting teammate or through aggressive double switching. This also hampers its ability to check many Pokemon most other Steel-types can handle, such as Latias and Nihilego. Magneton's poor defensive capabilities are further compounded by its weaknesses to common Ground-, Fighting-, and Fire-type moves, which are often run as coverage by several Pokemon it could otherwise pressure, like Mega Aggron, Mega Altaria, and Togekiss. Its Speed is also extremely poor for an offensive Pokemon, leaving it outsped by the vast majority of the offensive metagame without a Choice Scarf and by Pokemon like Mega Aerodactyl and Zeraora even with a Choice Scarf. These flaws often prevent Magneton from being able to reliably provide for its team outside of its role as a trapper, meaning it faces severe competition from other Electric-types with stronger defining characteristics and niches, like Rotom-H and Mega Manectric, and should usually never be run unless trapping Steel-types is desired, making it a very niche Pokemon.", "Duosion": "Duosion is a niche Calm Mind user thanks to its ability in Magic Guard, which allows it to not be easily worn down through means such as Toxic poison, Leech Seed, and hail, especially alongside its reliable recovery. Duosion's high Special Attack also gives it a solid amount of offensive presence, especially after setting up. However, its low Speed can be problematic, as it forces Duosion to take a hit before setting up, which doesn't pair well with its mediocre bulk even with Eviolite. Other Calm Mind users like Mesprit, Musharna, and Clefairy all share certain traits with Duosion, with the former two being Psychic-types and the latter having Magic Guard, giving Duosion a lot of competition. Mesprit and Musharna don't depend on Eviolite for their bulk, which allows them to hold alternate items, and can serve as consistent Fighting-type checks, but they lack Duosion's longevity. Clefairy is able to switch into many threats and use support moves like Stealth Rock and Thunder Wave throughout the game before setting up but has much lower Special Attack and Defense. Duosion also suffers from having only four moveslots, forcing it to choose between having a better matchup against physical attackers or Dark-types, which both give it trouble otherwise.", "Forretress": "Forretress's huge Defense stat lets it act as one of the best physical sponges in the tier, being able to switch into threats like Linoone, Flygon, and Bewear. Its access to all entry hazards and Rapid Spin makes it an appealing choice on teams that desire its ability to compress several roles in one, and its access to slow Volt Switch allows it to bring teammates in safely and avoid as much passivity as possible. Forretress's amazing typing only leaves it with a single weakness, although its neutrality to Rock and Flying as a Steel-type can put a strain on teambuilding. However, Forretress's extremely lacking base 60 Special Defense makes special attackers a huge threat to watch out for. Due to Forretress's lacking offensive presence beyond Volt Switch and Toxic, it is easily spinblocked by common Ghost-types like Mismagius and Alolan Marowak, while hazard removers such as Mega Blastoise, Sigilyph, and Mandibuzz are able to switch into it with impunity and remove whatever hazards Forretress had set up; this is somewhat mitigated by Forretress's ability to pivot out of them or put them on a timer with Toxic, however. Furthermore, a lack of reliable recovery means it is prone to being whittled down by Stealth Rock and other residual damage. Although Forretress's very low Speed stat will increase Gyro Ball's power, it will otherwise often be moving last against most Pokemon in the tier, which hinders its ability as a spinner and hazard setter; Pokemon like Rhyperior are able to KO it before it gets the opportunity to use Rapid Spin or Spikes. Lastly, Forretress possesses a crippling weakness to Fire, one of the best offensive typings in the meta, which severely undermines its defensive utility.", "Skarmory": "Between its excellent physical bulk, great defensive typing, and access to reliable recovery, Skarmory is one of the best physically defensive blanket checks in the game, being able to consistently check a variety of dangerous physical attackers such as Landorus-T and Tapu Bulu; furthermore, it is extremely hard to wear down with passive damage due to its immunity to Spikes and Toxic. This, combined with its access to good utility options in Whirlwind, Defog, and Spikes, makes Skarmory a stellar pick for balance and stall teams. That said, it faces heavy competition from Celesteela, which makes up for a lack of Spikes and Roost with significantly higher special bulk and access to Leech Seed, and Skarmory's low HP and Special Defense stats make it easy for special attackers to take advantage of and unable to take resisted special attacks repeatedly. Furthermore, Skarmory is heavily strapped for moveslots and immensely passive, often having to rely on Counter to exert any real offensive presence; this results in it being complete Taunt bait.", "Burmy": null, "Goomy": "Goomy has access to the ability Sap Sipper, which might look appealing to use to soak up Grass-type attacks from the likes of Foongus and Snivy; however, outside of checking Grass-types, it fails to do anything else because it has no reliable recovery options and a poor Special Attack stat. Despite having Sap Sipper, Goomy is outclassed by other Grass-type checks like Vullaby, Pawniard, and Foongus because of their better offensive stats, their bulk, typings, and utility beyond simply checking Grass-types.", "Volbeat": "Volbeat is one of the tier's best weather setters due to Prankster, decent bulk, and key resistances to Ground and Fighting. Access to both Rain Dance and Sunny Day makes Volbeat a superb choice for hyper offensive rain and sun teams alike. Additionally, Volbeat has an array of utility support options like Defog, Thunder Wave, Encore and Roost, as well as U-turn for pivoting. However, Volbeat suffers from a weakness to Stealth Rock and being incredibly passive, meaning it can usually only get up sun or rain twice per game.", "Unown": "This is completely outclassed by Mesprit.", "Oddish": "While Oddish has decent stats going for it as well as a powerful utility move in Strength Sap, it is not viable due to the lack of a good ability, and it faces heavy competition in any role it wants to fulfill. It is fully outclassed by Foongus as a bulky Grass-type due to Regenerator and better bulk, as well as Morelull due to Effect Spore and its better matchup against Fighting-types. Even in sun, which isn't viable either, Bulbasaur and Bellsprout completely outclass it due to better offensive presence, higher Speed stats, and the ability to set up.", "Bronzong": "Bronzong is able to check a wide variety of threats in the tier, such as Flygon, Mega Glalie, Dragalge, Choice Scarf Tyrantrum, and Comfey, thanks to its amazing Steel / Psychic typing, which grants it nine resistances and an immunity. Bronzong's Levitate ability also gives it an immunity to what would otherwise be a weakness, leaving it with just three weaknesses, and its high defensive stats allow it to check many specially offensive Pokemon such as Swellow, Gardevoir, Diancie, and Necrozma. Bronzong is also a solid setter of Stealth Rock thanks to its great bulk. However, it is extremely passive and lets in various threats for free. A very low Speed stat both hurts it and helps it; Bronzong will almost always be taking a hit before moving, but it also increases the power of its Gyro Ball. Bronzong is also hurt by the plethora of good Dark-types in the tier, including Sneasel, Drapion, and Pangoro which makes it harder for it to do its job. This is further exemplified by its weakness to Knock Off, as its lack of recovery outside of Leftovers makes it very easy to wear down after losing its item.", "Delcatty": "Delcatty's bad movepool and poor stats bar its decent Speed make it completely outclassed by other Normal-types such as Stoutland and Alolan Raticate. However, the most notable is Kangaskhan, which, on top of having the same Speed stat and double priority, has a better movepool, better stats, and an ability that allows it to hit Ghost-types, rather than be completely walled by them like in Delcatty's case.", "Accelgor": "Thanks to Accelgor's blistering Speed stat, great Special Attack in tandem with Choice Specs, and valuable coverage coupled with utility moves like Spikes, Accelgor cements itself as a huge annoyance to teams. Adding onto the point of Accelgor's coverage, Accelgor is capable of dealing massive damage to many unsuspecting Pokemon, such as hitting Steelix with Focus Blast. Accelgor outpaces the most common Choice Scarf user in NU, Passimian, making Accelgor even more menacing to teams where Passimian is the designated Choice Scarf holder. Unfortunately, Accelgor has rather lackluster defensive stats and a poor defensive typing, making it extremely difficult to use efficiently and preventing it from switching into nearly anything in the metagame well.", "Mightyena": "Subpar stats across the board leave Mightyena completely outclassed by Absol and Alolan Raticate, which sport far higher Attack stats and better Speed tiers. The aforementioned Pokemon also have access to Swords Dance and possess a more useful Dark-type STAB move in Knock Off. Mightyena's niche lies in attempting to revenge kill opposing pokemon to get Attack boosts from Moxie, but it does not do its job properly because it ends up being too weak to kill anything and it lacks the defenses to stay in for long periods of time.", "Caterpie": null, "Growlithe": null, "Hoopa": "Hoopa's good offensive typing, ability to outspeed most defensive Pokemon, and massive Special Attack stat give it the tools to seriously bust holes in opposing teams. This is bolstered by its access to Nasty Plot and All-Out Pummeling, which further increases Hoopa's wallbreaking potential and allows it to muscle past would-be checks such as Alolan Muk and Blissey with ease after some mild chip damage. Hoopa also boasts impressive 80 / 130 special bulk, allowing it to take on the likes of Latias and Suicune. However, Hoopa's greatest strength, its Ghost / Psychic typing, is also its greatest weakness, giving it a 4x weakness to Pursuit, thus limiting its matchup versus offensively inclined teams. In addition, Hoopa's poor Speed and Defense stats leave it forced out by common physical attackers, such as Cobalion and Infernape. Finally, Hoopa faces stiff competition as an offensive Ghost-type from the likes of Chandelure and Gengar, which offer better Speed and utility than Hoopa. Other Psychic-types like Celebi, Latias, and Starmie also offer better Speed and utility and less vulnerability to Pursuit trapping. Hoopa's ability, Magician, also is useless in every situation.", "Munna": null, "Groudon": null, "Wynaut": "Wynaut is the only Pokemon with Shadow Tag in the current LC metagame, which allows it to trap any non-Ghost-type Pokemon. What separates it from the other trappers in LC is that it boasts an amazing base 95 HP stat, one of the highest in the tier, compensating for its otherwise mediocre defensive stats. However, due to its poor movepool with very few useful options in Counter, Mirror Coat, Encore, Safeguard, and Tickle, its offensive value is null. Thanks to Wynaut's great HP stat, Counter and Mirror Coat will almost always result in OHKOs or 2HKOs, and Encore alongside to Shadow Tag can give defensive threats problems. Unfortunately, Wynaut lacks the Speed required to reliably pull off its status moves, and it also lacks recovery, besides Berry Juice. While Psychic is a good defensive typing that allows Wynaut to take Fighting-type attacks, it makes it vulnerable to Knock Off, which is very common, and U-turn, which significantly damages Wynaut and makes its ability to trap Pokemon useless.", "Kyogre": null, "Rayquaza": null, "Diglett": "Despite poor defensive stats and mediocre offensive stats, Diglett is one of the defining Pokemon of the Little Cup metagame thanks to its ability Arena Trap, which allows it to revenge kill grounded Pokemon without giving them the option to switch out. Diglett is helped in its revenge killing by a high Speed stat, which allows it to tie for the fastest unboosted Pokemon in the metagame, and a useful offensive typing that gives it super effective STAB coverage on a wide variety of Pokemon. Its moveset is also somewhat customizable, with its movepool including options such as Sucker Punch and Sludge Bomb, allowing it to, for the most part, trap and take on whatever Pokemon its team needs removed. A wide variety of support moves are also at its disposal, allowing Diglett to support its team after trapping the Pokemon it aims to eliminate.", "Diggersby": "Diggersby isn't necessarily a bad wallbreaker; in fact, it's actually quite difficult to switch into. Its main issue, however, is that it faces immense competition from other wallbreakers such as Mega Medicham, Mega Mawile, and even Hoopa-U. Diggersby's below average Speed stat and subpar defensive typing leave it very vulnerable to common offensive threats such as Greninja, Kartana, and Kyurem-B. Its mediocre bulk is also problematic because anything it fails to OHKO will most likely deal a heavy amount of damage to it, so it will often be dead weight against offensive teams. Overall, Diggersby has almost nothing to distinguish itself from the plethora of other wallbreakers in the tier, and there's just very little reason to use it over something else.", "Garchomp": "Thanks to its access to Swords Dance, solid coverage moves, and good Speed and Attack stats, Garchomp is a strong wallbreaker capable of threatening the majority of the tier. Its ability to put pressure on most Defoggers such as Tornadus-T and Zapdos by virtue of its Z-Move also makes it a reliable entry hazard setter. In a defensive role, Garchomp is capable of checking numerous threats, such as Heatran, Mega Scizor, and Hawlucha, either dealing with them completely or at least crippling them with the combination of Rough Skin and Rocky Helmet. This set's role compression doesn't stop there, though, as it also can set up Stealth Rock and pressure opposing Defoggers with Toxic while phazing setup sweepers with Roar or Dragon Tail. Mega Garchomp's added bulk and firepower under sand makes it a formidable wallbreaker, hitting anything with its STAB and coverage moves hard while finding many opportunities to set up with Swords Dance. Unfortunately, Garchomp faces competition in its roles. Defensively, Gliscor can be a better choice on some teams, as it can be a better check to non-offensive Heatran, has a reliable recovery move in Roost, and can either set up or remove hazards from the field. Also, Mega Garchomp, while being a powerful wallbreaker, faces huge competition from its normal forme and other Mega Evolutions, since the Speed that Mega Garchomp loses when it Mega Evolves can be troublesome. Upon Mega Evolving, it becomes slower than Tapu Lele and Hydreigon, two Pokemon that can be dealt with its non-Mega Speed stat.", "Skitty": "Although Normalize might seem enticing, it's not enough to make Skitty even remotely worth using. As a Normal-type attacker, Skitty is far outclassed by Bunnelby and Zigzagoon, and even as a revenge killer Meowth has it beat. Skitty has defenses of wet tissue paper and hits only nearly as hard, and the thing that makes it even a little useful, Normalize, takes away any and all coverage whatsoever. Its all-around poor stats make it an unviable choice on any team, even if it is very cute.", "Zekrom": null, "Wurmple": null, "Pikipek": "At first glance, Pikipek may seem an underwhelming choice; it boasts overall mediocre stats, has almost nonexistent defenses, and does not have many coverage options. Secondly, there are stronger Flying-types like Doduo, Archen, and Rufflet that can work better than Pikipek, which has to rely on Brave Bird and Life Orb to deal significant damage, meaning that it will constantly lose its HP in the process; this combined with a weakness to Stealth Rock makes it difficult for Pikipek to be efficient. However, Pikipek carves itself a small niche that makes it truly shine and, more importantly, it doesn't share with any other Flying-type Pokemon in LC: access to Bullet Seed and Skill Link, meaning that it can remove Rock-types with ease, even Sturdy + Berry Juice ones. It also sports respectable Attack and Speed stats, letting it deal a solid amount of damage with its STAB or coverage moves and outspeed Pokemon such as Pawniard and Rufflet with ease. While far from being the premier LC Flying-type, Pikipek can prove to be a good pick on teams searching a way to beat opposing leads and check a good number of Rock- and Water-types.", "Cinccino": "Cinccino's ability in Skill Link gives it great power on its main STAB move, Tail Slap. Thanks to its coverage options in Bullet Seed and Knock Off, it can threaten many Normal-resistant and -immune foes in the metagame such as Rhydon and Palossand and serve as a powerful wallbreaker, as well as a late-game cleaner if its faster checks have been removed from the battle. Cinccino also sits at a fantastic Speed tier, being able to outspeed the likes of Mismagius, Delphox, and +1 Scrafty. Thanks to Skill Link, Cinccino can prevent Substitute users like Braviary and Vivillon from safely setting up behind one. However, despite its great Speed tier, Cinccino fails to outspeed common offensive threats such as Sceptile and Whimsicott, as well as Choice Scarf users like Braviary, Passimian, and Heliolisk. In addition, due to its frailty, Cinccino finds it hard to switch directly into foes; this also means it is pressured into OHKOing its foes to avoid being OHKOed in return. Finally, Cinccino also has major difficulty in dealing with Steel-types such as the common Steelix and Rocky Helmet users such as Garbodor, Vileplume, and Xatu.", "Tentacool": "Tentacool's great Special Defense and decent Speed along with a good movepool allow it to be a decent entry hazard remover. It also has a good defensive typing, resisting common types like Fighting and Fairy. It doesn't have a slacking offensive movepool, either, with access to Sludge Bomb, Knock Off, and Scald. However, its actual attacking stats are lackluster, as is its physical bulk. Its longevity isn't helped by the fact that it doesn't have any reliable recovery outside Berry Juice, and it faces competition from other Water- / Poison-types like Skrelp and Mareanie. Nevertheless, Tentacool sets itself apart from these Pokemon by having access to Rapid Spin and a better Speed stat.", "Scrafty": "Scrafty is a great setup sweeper due to the combination of its unique typing, great bulk, and amazing abilities. Said unique typing gives Scrafty great STAB moves, including Knock Off, High Jump Kick, and Drain Punch, which let it handle common Dark-, Ghost-, and Psychic-types such as Incineroar, Rotom, and Slowking. Thanks to its great bulk, Scrafty has an easy time setting up on passive Pokemon and can make teams that depend on common defensive cores, like Steelix + Slowking and Vaporeon + Silvally-Steel, really struggle. The ability Shed Skin gives Scrafty a way to also set up on Pokemon like Rotom and Vaporeon, which rely on spreading status conditions with moves like Will-O-Wisp and Toxic. However, Scrafty has a really poor Speed tier, making it easy to revenge kill with common Choice Scarf users like Passimian and other fast Pokemon like Whimsicott and Sceptile even after a Dragon Dance boost. It's also extremely susceptible to Fairy-types, like Whimsicott, Aromatisse, and Comfey, and Pokemon that run Fairy-type coverage moves, such as Mismagius and Delphox.", "Lilligant": "Access to Quiver Dance along with good base Special Attack, usable Speed, and the ability to create setup opportunities with Sleep Powder makes Lilligant one of the best setup sweepers in the tier. Despite its shallow coverage, Lilligant can utilize Z-Moves well to break through otherwise checks such as Drampa and Clefairy. Access to Healing Wish provides Lilligant with another potential role as a niche Choice Scarf user, though it receives stiff competition from other Choice Scarf users such as Primeape, which boast better coverage and Speed. Unfortunately, Lilligant's Speed is far from ideal, meaning Quiver Dance sets are revenge killed by common Choice Scarf users such as Primeape and Haunter, whereas Choice Scarf sets fail to revenge kill fast Speed-boosting sweepers like Jynx. Its poor physical bulk means it's vulnerable to priority such as Abomasnow's Ice Shard and Skuntank's Sucker Punch. The Quiver Dance set's reliance on Z-Moves mean that mispredicting can ruin its sweep.", "Wailmer": "Despite having access to the strong Water Spout, Wailmer lacks of the offensive presence to take advantage of it properly, as its Special Attack is low, and a lack of coverage options leaves it walled by a majority of threats in the metagame. Relying on Water Spout as an attacking move also means Wailmer is severely crippled by chip damage from entry hazards and priority moves, reducing its effectiveness. Its Speed allows many metagame threats such as Snivy and Gastly to outspeed it and KO it, as Wailmer isn't very bulky, which forces it to run Choice Scarf. Furthermore, its defensive stats leave it with mediocre bulk. Finally, Staryu and Frillish are better specially offensive Water-types, with the two former boasting better coverage, power, and Speed and the latter being a much better Water Spout user, which invalidates Wailmer's use on any serious team.", "Dewott": null, "Magmar": null, "Lucario": null, "Rampardos": "Rampardos fills a tiny niche in the PU metagame due to its monstrous Attack stat that complements its ability Sheer Force. Head Smash's overwhelming power combined with coverage moves such as Zen Headbutt gives Rampardos the minuscule niche of a Choice Scarf user. However, Rampardos faces massive competition from Lycanroc, which is naturally fast, has priority, and can utilize Swords Dance if it gains the opportunity. Rampardos also has competition against Aggron as a wallbreaker due to its ability able to spam Head Smash with zero drawbacks. While a Choice Scarf is able to patch up Rampardos's middling Speed, it still fails to outspeed faster threats like Lycanroc, Alolan Persian, Floatzel, and other Choice Scarf users like Primeape, Kabutops, and Mesprit. Furthermore, Rampardos's primary attack, Head Smash, racks up recoil damage fairly easily, which further hinders its longevity. Rampardos is also pretty susceptible to priority moves like Mach Punch and Aqua Jet, which aren't too uncommon to come across in PU.", "Feebas": null, "Charmeleon": null, "Buizel": "Despite having an excellent Speed tier and decent mixed offensive stats, Buizel struggles in Little Cup because of its poor defensive stats and underwhelming movepool. Buizel is completely outclassed by Staryu, as Staryu has better stats across the board, as well as a superior movepool and more useful abilities.", "Scolipede": "Scolipede can fulfill the role of a cleaner and wallbreaker in one slot due to its access to Speed Boost and Swords Dance to threaten offensive and defensive teams. Functioning in these roles is enabled by decent Attack, good Speed, and a sufficient movepool, so Scolipede can utilize strong attacks and coverage moves such as Megahorn, Earthquake, and Aqua Tail. However, Scolipede's below average defenses mean Scolipede will require entry hazard removal to set up properly. Even if Scolipede manages to set up, it will often be in range of priority moves from Ash-Greninja, Mega Scizor, and Mega Mawile, for example, meaning its capabilities cannot be fully unleashed in practice.", "Serperior": "Serperior's ability to spam Leaf Storm and receive a Special Attack boost due to Contrary makes it a fantastic cleaner for offensively inclined teams that require its ability to handle various threats such as Tapu Bulu, Clefable, and Tapu Koko. A good matchup against Sticky Web teams due to Contrary and the ability to overpower balance staples such as Clefable and Toxapex makes Serperior excellent against a good portion of the meta. Serperior is also able to take advantage of its switch-ins through the use of Substitute, allowing it to safely use Glare to cripple offensive threats, or Leech Seed to annoy passive Pokemon, limiting its defensive counterplay. Additionally, an amazing Speed tier lets Serperior outspeed many relevant offensive threats such as Mega Latios, Kartana, and Mega Medicham. However, its mediocre bulk means it's a Grass-type that is unable to check Ash-Greninja and switch into strong attacks, and a bad Special Attack stat also means Serperior struggles to deal damage right away.", "Shieldon": "Although it has good defences and access to Sturdy and Stealth Rock, Shieldon is unviable in Little Cup due to its low Speed stat and undesirable weaknesses to the prevalent Fighting and Ground types. In addition, it has poor offensive stats and lacks good STAB moves. Overall, Shieldon is outclassed by Dwebble, Onix, and Tirtouga, as these can all run Sturdy sets more effectively.", "Pyukumuku": "Due to Pyukumuku's combination of good defensive stats, a pure Water typing, access to reliable recovery, and an amazing ability in Unaware, it's able to carve itself a decent niche by being an Unaware user with better overall bulk than both Quagsire and Clefable, allowing it to handle certain setup sweepers and offensive threats such as Mega Pinsir, Mega Swampert, and Manaphy better than the other two, while having useful and unique utility options in Block, Spite, and Soak that make the target unable to switch out, lower the target's PP, or allow it to poison Steel- and Poison-types. Aside from being an Unaware wall, Pyukumuku's other role is that of a bulky trapper that is able to either PP or Toxic stall passive targets such as Clefable, Gliscor, and Celesteela. This is incredibly useful for stall teams that want to remove a specific nuisance early on. However, Pyukumuku is a massive momentum drain, so much so that it basically requires that you use it exclusively on stall teams where its teammates can make up for its shortcomings. It also has a barren movepool, leaving it both one-dimensional and predictable. Due to not having any attacking options and only being able to inflict damage with Toxic, Pyukumuku is extremely passive and will lose to any Taunt users while being severely annoyed by Substitute users. Finally, even though it has a lot of unique features going for it, Pyukumuku can still fall behind the other Unaware users; Quagsire having actual attacking options prevents it from being complete Taunt bait, and it also checks Choice Band Tyranitar and provides a useful Electric immunity, while Clefable can support teammates with the use of Heal Bell and Wish.", "Victini": "Thanks to an insanely high Base Power STAB attack in V-create, a great coverage option in Bolt Strike, and utility in U-turn and Trick, Victini can operate effectively in OU as either a Choice Scarf or Choice Band user. Victini's unique typing and good bulk gives it many opportunities to switch in against common threats in the OU tier and wreak havoc. Alternatively, Victini can use a Z-Celebrate set to boost all its stats once per match, becoming a terrifying late-game sweeper that can be difficult to revenge kill. Stored Power is very strong after a boost, and with a useful coverage option in Focus Blast, Victini has the ability to shred through common defensive cores as well as offensive teams. Its good bulk and somewhat useful resistances give Victini plenty of chances to setup. Unfortunately, Victini's average attacking stats forces it to heavily rely on Z-Celebrate's boosts in order to pose much of a threat when running this set. Furthermore, Victini's typing causes it to be weak to every form of entry hazard as well as common priority, such as Sucker Punch and Water Shuriken.", "Phione": "Phione is practically unviable thanks to its subpar base 80 stats across the board. It is relegated to being a Rain Dance pivot that can keep itself healthy thanks to Heal Bell and Hydration, but even in the only role it can take it is outclassed by Mesprit and Liepard thanks to their better stats and abilities overall.", "Froslass": "Froslass serves as a top Spikes setter thanks to its combination of high Speed and great utility options like Taunt, Will-O-Wisp, and Destiny Bond. On top of its near-unresisted STAB type combination, Froslass's typing makes it the only Spikes user able to simultaneously serve as a spinblocker and pressure many Defog users like Altaria and Silvally-Fairy offensively or with Taunt, making it the best entry hazard setter to threaten both forms of hazard removal. Between its bulky and offensive Spikes sets and its Choice Specs set, Froslass has a solid amount of versatility in terms of items and moves; this additionally makes it difficult for the opponent to know what set it's running, which it can use to its advantage to set up a layer of Spikes or lure in a threat such as Skuntank. However, bar Froslass's Speed, its stats are very mediocre, leaving it somewhat weak and frail at times. Its typing does not help much with this, making Froslass susceptible to foes that outspeed it like Lycanroc and Choice Scarf Togedemaru, Pursuit trappers like Skuntank, and various other potential threats like Stoutland. Froslass's typing also makes it struggle as a spinblocker due to its weakness to common coverage moves like Hitmonchan's Stone Edge and Alolan Sandslash's Knock Off, although moves like Will-O-Wisp can help make up for this somewhat. It is also weak to Stealth Rock and not immune to the other hazards, making it easily worn down, especially due to its lack of recovery outside of Leftovers on its bulky set. Finally, Froslass does have slight competition as a Spikes users with Qwilfish, which has a better defensive presence with its good defensive typing and Intimidate, as well as another utility option in Toxic Spikes.", "Oshawott": null, "Staraptor": "For the most part, Staraptor is outclassed by other revenge killers and late-game cleaners in the tier, such as Kartana and Landorus-T, due to the extreme detriment of constant recoil damage from its STAB attacks, which easily puts it in range of priority from Pokemon such as Mega Mawile and Ash-Greninja. Additionally, Staraptor's extreme frailty with no notable advantage over other hard-hitting revenge killers such as Tapu Lele and Kartana ensures that it's a fringe option at best.", "Giratina": null, "Beartic": "Beartic has a very high Attack stat that can be boosted via Swords Dance and fulfills the role of a sweeper under rain or hail. Despite this, it has a bad defensive typing and only average bulk. Its worst negative, however, is its Speed. Beartic is very slow, and even under hail or rain, Choice Scarf users like Primeape, Haunter, Swanna and Jynx outspeed it and proceed to revenge kill it with their STAB moves. As a rain sweeper, it is outclassed by Kabutops, and as a hail sweeper, by Alolan Sandslash. Both of these Pokemon boast a secondary STAB typing, aren't weak to Stealth Rock and actually outspeed the aforementioned Choice Scarf users under the weather.", "Cloyster": "Cloyster's offensive typing in conjunction with its access to Shell Smash makes it stand out over other Water-types in the current RU metagame. After using Shell Smash, Cloyster jumps to an outstanding Speed tier, becoming a potent cleaner that can be really hard to stop and difficult to revenge kill outside a select pool of Choice Scarf users like Salazzle and finding itself able to punish many team compositions that include multiple Ice-weak Pokemon like Nidoqueen, Xatu, and Chesnaught. Furthermore, Cloyster's amazing ability Skill Link allows it to make good use of moves like Icicle Spear and Rock Blast, enabling it to break through Focus Sashes and Sturdy. Finally, Cloyster's gargantuan Defense stat that provides it with plenty of setup opportunities against a good number of physical attackers like Flygon, Snorlax, Araquanid, and Zygarde-10%. However, being weak to all form of entry hazards means that Cloyster has to be preserved for late-game, since it gets worn down rather easily by those, removing potential setup opportunities. Cloyster also lacks the coverage to hit Steel-types like Registeel, Escavalier, and Bronzong and other defensive Pokemon like Cresselia, so it becomes a less appealing choice over its Water-type competition like Feraligatr and Bruxish. Finally, an abysmal Special Defense stat means that even resisted special hits will do excessive amounts of damage to Cloyster, which means it can't afford to setup against any kind of special attacker.", "Yungoos": "Yungoos is directly outclassed by Bunnelby due to the latter's access to a far superior ability in Huge Power, STAB priority in Quick Attack, and a slightly better Speed tier, allowing it to perform more consistently as a revenge killer. Despite its manageable movepool and a solid ability in Adaptability, Yungoos is unviable in the Little Cup metagame and has nothing to distinguish it from the likes of Bunnelby, Meowth, and Zigzagoon.", "Vibrava": null, "Salamence": null, "Drampa": "Drampa's monstrous base 135 Special Attack, access to high-Base Power STAB moves, solid offensive typing, and excellent Special movepool cement its role as one of the most devastating wallbreakers in the PU metagame, with almost no safe switch-ins. Thanks to its typing and access to Sap Sipper, Drampa functions as a solid pivot into Grass-type moves from Pokemon such as Lilligant and Gourgeist, and it can use its somewhat decent bulk to switch into passive Pokemon like Regirock, defensive Omastar, and Weezing without taking much damage. Despite Drampa's exceptional offensive prowess, it is plagued with being one of the slowest Pokemon in the tier, and its typing gives it notable weaknesses to Ice-, Fairy-, and the common Fighting-type Pokemon. This, more often than not, leaves Drampa vulnerable to Pokemon such as Hitmonchan, Jynx, and Silvally-Fairy picking it off once they've been sent in.", "Meditite": null, "Yamask": null, "Garbodor": "Garbodor is one of NU's most reliable Spikes setters thanks to its workable bulk, its very useful defensive typing, and its power that allows it to forcibly bypass Xatu. Furthermore, Garbodor's pure Poison typing and above average defensive stats mean it can function as a check to some of NU's most threatening Pokemon in Passimian and Comfey. A wide offensive movepool combined with workable base 95 Attack lets Garbodor threaten Xatu with a STAB Gunk Shot while threatening Pokemon such as Seismitoad and Silvally-Steel with Seed Bomb and Stomping Tantrum. In addition, a utility movepool including Spikes and Toxic Spikes and options such as Explosion and Pain Split gives Garbodor the ability to easily set up entry hazards against an enemy team and either keep them up or keep itself healthy. However, while Gunk Shot is fairly powerful, Garbodor's only good Attack means that it struggles to threaten Pokemon such as Rhydon and Steelix, even with its coverage options. Furthermore, while its bulk is good enough to take resisted hits, Garbodor finds itself taking significant damage from neutral attacks, and it finds itself threatened by coverage moves, taking very heavy damage from Passimian's Earthquake and Whimsicott's Psychic.", "Marowak": "With its Thick Club in hand, Marowak can act as a suboptimal Trick Room attacker. Marowak's near-perfect coverage between Earthquake and Stone Edge may sound enticing at first, but several other physical Trick Room attackers such as Crabominable and Ursaring have near-perfect coverage also. Marowak also must hold a Thick Club in order to double its Attack, which makes it susceptible to Knock Off users such as Tangela and Gurdurr.", "Glaceon": "The only reason to use Glaceon over the otherwise superior Aurorus is its access to Z-Celebrate, which is a mediocre set due to Glaceon's poor defensive typing that gives it a hard time setting up, its shallow movepool, and the move's one-time-use nature. It also is easily revenge killed by the likes of Choice Scarf Primeape and Kabutops and is unable to deal significant damage to threats like Articuno and Lanturn, leaving it easily taken care of.", "Litleo": null, "Surskit": "Surskit owns the title of fastest Sticky Web setter in Little Cup due to its ability to reach the 17 Speed benchmark, allowing it to outspeed a lot of the unboosted meta. Not only does Surskit have access to Sticky Web, but it also has an assortment of supportive and offensive options such as Ice Beam, Giga Drain, and Haze at its disposal. However, Surskit is quite weak due to its low base stats bar its Speed, with a lackluster Special Attack stat that only reaches the 14 benchmark and poor natural bulk. Bug and Water is also a relatively weak defensive typing, making Surskit vulnerable to the tier's multitude of Electric- and Flying-types. Surskit also loses to many common entry hazard setters and removers such as Vullaby and Onix, making it harder for it to set up Sticky Web while also forcing the player to use Surskit conservatively until all entry hazard removers are eliminated. While Sticky Web is an invaluable asset for teams dedicated to using it to its full potential, it can be difficult to utilize if the opposing team has naturally slow Pokemon such as Munchlax, airborne Pokemon such as Gastly and Vullaby, or Pokemon that can take advantage of the Speed drop such as Snivy and Pawniard.", "Croconaw": null, "Graveler": null, "Naganadel": null, "Happiny": null, "Darkrai": null, "Mew": "Mew's niche comes from its typing, stats, and movepool, which allow it to defensively check a few top-tier Pokemon such as Landorus-T, Mega Medicham, Garchomp, and Gliscor and provide Stealth Rock or Defog support. It's also a terrifying sweeper, as it can easily find setup opportunities thanks to its good bulk and typing, and its wide movepool enables it to pick its own checks and counters. However, status ailments are prominent in the metagame, and Mew wants to stay away from them, as they compromise its ability to check threats such as Mega Medicham reliably if hazards are up, which may very well be possible if Mew is used as a Defogger. Furthermore, defensive Mew's rather passive nature can allow Pokemon such as Ash-Greninja and Mega Alakazam to switch in freely, depending on the moves it is running.", "Hippowdon": "Hippowdon's great bulk and solid defensive typing allow it to act as a great wall, checking prominent threats such as Cobalion and Mega Manectric. Its bulk also allows it to make good use of support options such as Stealth Rock, and it even has access to reliable recovery in Slack Off. Additionally, its Sand Stream ability can be used to support teammates and wear down the opponent's team. However, Hippowdon is held back by its low Speed, forcing it to typically take an attack before being able to do anything. It is also weak to common offensive types in Water, Grass, and Ice. Finally, being a really passive Stealth Rock user, Hippowdon is forced to rely on Whirlwind in order to not become setup fodder.", "Bellossom": "Bellossom's exclusive access to both Strength Sap and Quiver Dance provides it with a unique niche, allowing Bellossom to stand out from its fellow Grass-type sweepers such as Lilligant by performing the role of a bulky Quiver Dance sweeper. The first of Bellossom's great niches as a sweeper lies in Strength Sap, which increases its longevity while making up for its lack of defensive investment, allowing Bellossom to force physical attackers such as Gurdurr and Stoutland to switch out after lowering their Attack. Quiver Dance allows Bellossom to avoid becoming overwhelmed by special attackers, outspeed and deal significant damage to neutral or super effective targets, and even sometimes sweep if Bellossom's checks and counters are removed or weakened. However, straying away from its niche in Strength Sap causes Bellossom, for the most part, to be outclassed by the other more offensive Grass-type Quiver Dance user in PU, Lilligant. This stems from Lilligant's ability to run Sleep Powder, outspeed, and break past common threats such as Dodrio after a Quiver Dance, whereas Bellossom fails to do so. Bellossom also has incredibly average stats before boosting, which can cause it to be overwhelmed by physical and special wallbreakers such as Alolan Raticate and Nasty Plot Jynx or outsped by the likes of Choice Scarf Dodrio and Slush Rush Alolan Sandslash, which all can OHKO or 2HKO Bellossom.", "Blissey": "Colossal base HP, high base Special Defense, and only one weakness make Blissey the premier special wall in UU, and thanks to its access to various support moves such as Wish and Heal Bell, Blissey finds itself a staple on stall teams. Furthermore, Blissey's ability Natural Cure in combination with reliable recovery in Soft-Boiled makes it very hard to wear down. However, despite access to Seismic Toss and Toxic, Blissey is quite passive, and as a result, it is shut down by Taunt users, such as Krookodile and Gengar. Blissey is also used as a setup fodder by Steel-types such as Scizor and Cobalion, which are immune to Toxic, and bulky Substitute users, such as Suicune. In addition, a poor Defense stat means that Blissey is vulnerable to the most physical attackers in the tier, such as Mega Sharpedo and Terrakion. Overall, although Blissey is a reliable staple on Stall teams, it finds itself hard to fit onto playstyles other than stall and balance, and as a result, it is mostly restricted to them.", "Xerneas": null, "Darumaka": "Darumaka is a great wallbreaker with its exceptional base Attack and a great ability in Hustle, as it 2HKOes almost everything that doesn't resist it with Flare Blitz. Darumaka has access to other great moves like U-turn, allowing it to pivot, as well as good coverage in Superpower, Zen Headbutt, and Rock Slide. However, despite Hustle boosting Darumaka's Attack, it also lowers its accuracy, which can cost Darumaka a lot of damage or a KO from the foe if it misses. Its poor bulk and Flare Blitz recoil make it easy to wear down and really hard to switch in. Furthermore, it has a weakness to Stealth Rock, limiting how many times it can be switched in, as well as common Ground- and Water-types. Its awkward Speed tier forces it to hold a Choice Scarf, which leaves it easily revenge killed by a threat that resists the move it's Choice locked into.", "Metagross": null, "Tyrunt": "Tyrunt's high base Attack stat and solid base Defense stat make it a flexible Pokemon capable of performing offensive roles. Its STAB combination is not resisted by much in the tier other than the common Steel-types, and its great movepool gives it access to many coverage moves that hit specific threats. Tyrunt's typing enables it to check many Flying-type threats as well as some Fire-types. Furthermore, Tyrunt is able to have Sturdy, which works well in tandem with Berry Juice. Tyrunt's access to Dragon Dance allows it to be a formidable sweeper, and it can set up much more easily than other Dragon Dance sweepers. Unfortunately, its typing makes it vulnerable to the common Fighting-, Ground-, Ice-, and Steel-types in the tier. Tyrunt is also weak to common priority moves like Mach Punch and Vacuum Wave. Furthermore, its relatively low Speed stat means that it is outsped by many Choice Scarf users after a Dragon Dance boost, such as Mienfoo and Pawniard. Its low Special Defense can further hamper its sweeps from time to time. Tyrunt's lack of reliable recovery outside of Berry Juice makes it easily worn down. Tyrunt also faces competition from Sturdy Shell Smash users like Tirtouga and Dwebble, which can set up similarly easily but usually only need one boost to sweep.", "Palpitoad": null, "Lanturn": "Lanturn's unique set of resistances allows it to check specially offensive Electric-, Flying-, Water-, and Fire-types like Rotom-F, Oricorio-G, Swanna, and Simisear. Its large HP stat coupled with serviceable Special Defense, which can be further augmented through the use of an Assault Vest, grants it a niche in PU as a blanket check to a large portion of the tier's special attackers. In addition to running defensive sets because of its access to support moves like Heal Bell, Lanturn can also use offensive ones thanks to its wide movepool and usable Special Attack stat, which means the Pokemon that are able to set up on or take advantage of defensive Lanturn, like Lilligant, cannot always switch into Lanturn directly. Lanturn's ability to control momentum in battles is exceptional; not only is it able to block the opponent's attempts at gaining momentum with Volt Switch thanks to its ability Volt Absorb, but its own Volt Switch in conjunction with its lower Speed stat is also an effective tool for grabbing momentum as well as bringing in frail teammates like Haunter and Jynx safely. Despite Lanturn's lower Speed stat being useful in this context, it is also harmful in certain matchups, as faster offensive Pokemon with a type advantage like Shiftry and Alolan Dugtrio are able to outspeed and OHKO Lanturn. While Lanturn sports only two weaknesses, Ground- and Grass-type coverage moves are commonplace in PU and are regularly run by Pokemon that Lanturn switches into like Omastar and Manectric. This combined with Lanturn's vulnerability to entry hazards, its lack of reliable recovery, and its lackluster Defense stat can cause Lanturn to be worn down quickly over the course of a battle. Despite these weaknesses, however, Lanturn is still an overall advantageous choice for many different team archetypes, owing to both its ability to run offensive and defensive sets and the unparalleled team support that it provides.", "Litwick": "Despite a good offensive typing, Litwick's niche comes in the form of being a defensive Trick Room setter. Thanks to Flame Body and Will-O-Wisp, it can spread burns to cripple important threats while also facilitating Trick Room sweeps with Memento. However, full Trick Room teams are not very viable in Little Cup, and Litwick faces competition in its slot with Pumpkaboo-XL", "Stakataka": "Stakataka posseses an unique niche in the UU tier, as its respectable Attack stat in conjunction with one of the lowest Speed stats in the game gives it a monstrously strong Gyro Ball. In addition, Stakataka's ability to accrue boosts upon KOing opposing Pokemon through Beast Boost combined with its access to Trick Room can make it a devastating late-game sweeper under the right conditions. A Steel typing and massive 61 / 211 / 101 bulk make Stakataka a decent choice for offensive teams that struggle with common threats such as Latias and Crobat. However, Stakataka's secondary Rock typing hinders its defensive utility by leaving it vulnerable to common bulky Water-types like Swampert and Suicune and compounding its weakness to Ground- and Fighting-type moves, making Stakataka extremely vulnerable to common Pokemon in UU like Krookodile, Cobalion, and Hippowdon as well as leaving it extremely vulnerable to Mach Punch and Vacuum Wave from Infernape and Lucario, hindering its capacity to clean up under Trick Room. Stakataka is also extremely one-dimensional, as its movepool is quite limited outside of Trick Room and its STAB moves. Thus, the same pool of Pokemon that can check Stakataka will always be reliable stops to it.", "Quilladin": null, "Zweilous": null, "Beautifly": "Beautifly is an especially atrocious Pokemon. It may have access to Quiver Dance, but its horrendous bulk, subpar Speed, bad defensive and offensive typing, 4x Stealth Rock weakness, and lack of useful abilities or definable niche make it impossible to justify using over Lilligant or Bellossom thanks to their better stats overall and their ability to set up using Sleep Powder or Strength Sap, respectively.", "Blacephalon": "Blacephalon is blessed with an outstanding Special Attack stat, which, coupled with its great offensive typing in Fire / Ghost, turns it into a deadly wallbreaker. Blacephalon sets itself apart from other special wallbreakers thanks to its high Speed stat, which lets it act as a late-game cleaner and revenge killer when equipped with a Choice Scarf and outspeed a fair amount of the metagame without a boosting item. On top of that, Blacephalon's Beast Boost ability can boost its Special Attack by one stage after each KO or can be tuned to boost its Speed, further bolstering its late-game cleaning capabilities. However, Blacephalon has a fair amount of issues that hold it back in the metagame, such as an annoying vulnerability to every entry hazard and a weakness to Stealth Rock. Additionally, Blacephalon is weak to common priority moves like Ash-Greninja's Water Shuriken and Mega Mawile's Sucker Punch, which allows these Pokemon to stop a late-game sweep from it and gain momentum by forcing it out. Finally, the presence of Tyranitar as a top-tier threat in the metagame hurts Blacephalon's viability, since it's unable to 2HKO Tyranitar on the switch without prior damage and falls prey to Pursuit.", "Poliwag": "With its excellent Speed stat and access to Belly Drum, Poliwag can make a decent sweeper for offensive teams. Its access to Hypnosis can also help it set up and gives it a small niche over other Belly Drum users. However, better Belly Drum users such as Zigzagoon and, to an extent, Magby do a much better job at sweeping due to their access to good priority options. Poliwag is also held back by its relatively small movepool and paper-thin defenses, which keep it from finding reliable setup opportunities. It is incredibly vulnerable to being revenge killed by Choice Scarf and priority users as well. Finally, Poliwag needs a lot of support to even be worth using over other offensive Water-types and Belly Drum users.", "Delphox": "Delphox is a threatening Pokemon in NU due to its high Speed and Special Attack, great offensive typing, and fairly vast movepool that allows it to fulfill a number of roles, including a setup sweeper that breaks through defensive cores, a Wish passer, and a revenge killer that can also clean late-game. While it isn't perfect defensively, Delphox's typing in tandem with its decent bulk gives it the ability to soft check some of the most common special attackers such as Magmortar and Whimsicott as well as Fighting-types like Hariyama and Passimian. Delphox's access to useful coverage moves in Dazzling Gleam and Grass Knot also allows it to bypass a lot of typical Fire-type checks such as Guzzlord, Seismitoad, and Rhydon, and its access to moves such as Calm Mind, Trick, and Wish gives it the ability to support both itself and its teammates. However, Delphox suffers from an unfortunate weakness to Stealth Rock, which limits its ability to check the previously mentioned Pokemon consistently. Delphox's typing also leaves it vulnerable to Dark- and Rock-types such as Sneasel, Houndoom, and Aerodactyl as well as their STAB moves in Pursuit, Sucker Punch, and Stone Edge.", "Herdier": null, "Buzzwole": null, "Pelipper": "Pelipper's ability Drizzle makes it a staple on rain teams because it supports dangerous rain sweepers such as Mega Swampert, Ash-Greninja, Kingdra, and Qwilfish. Pelipper's typing allows it to check Pokemon such as Mega Scizor, defensive Landorus-T, Mega Charizard Y, and Choice Scarf Keldeo, the latter two of which are huge problems for rain teams. Pelipper's solid STAB moves and wide support movepool mean it can assist rain teams in two ways. On one hand, Pelipper can run a defensive Damp Rock set to extend rain turns and provide help its teammates switch in freely with its slow U-turn. On the other, Pelipper can break down conventional rain checks such as Toxapex and Ferrothorn with a Choice Specs set. Pelipper does have mediocre stats, however, which means it is easy to pressure and keep out with Pokemon such as Ash-Greninja, Tornadus-T, and Tapu Koko. Pelipper loses one-on-one to Tyranitar and Mega Charizard Y, which replace the rain with their own weather. Pelipper is also weak to Stealth Rock, which makes it an even more unreliable Defogger because it has to switch into the entry hazard to remove it.", "Avalugg": "Avalugg is a niche pick as a physical wall for bulkier archetypes such as stall. Its massive physical bulk allows it to stomach hits from pretty much any physical attacker that lacks super effective coverage to hit it, including physically oriented Gliscor, Mega Pinsir, and Mega Mawile lacking Iron Head. Rapid Spin also enables it to be a situational entry hazard remover, as it can switch into setters such as Landorus-T and Mega Swampert and spin their Stealth Rock away while they're forced out. Furthermore, Sturdy allows it to act as a last resort if Avalugg is at full health and a certain wallbreaker runs out of control, enabling it to tank a hit and fire back with a decently powerful Avalanche. Nonetheless, its defensive typing is possibly one of the worst in the game, allowing many physical attackers, such as Swords Dance Kartana, Swords Dance Mega Scizor, Tyranitar, and Mega Medicham, to overcome Avalugg without much struggle. Said typing also leaves it prone to being worn down by hazards, mostly Stealth Rock and Toxic Spikes. Avalugg's Special Defense is also very lackluster, leaving pretty much any special attacker able to break through it.", "Talonflame": "Talonflame is able to carve a small niche in the UU metagame as a threatening sweeper and revenge killer for offensive teams thanks to its great speed, excellent offensive typing, ability Gale Wings, and access to the boosting move Swords Dance. Its Fire / Flying typing allows it to hit most of the metagame for neutral damage and grants it key resistances to Fire-, Fighting-, and Fairy-type attacks as well as an immunity to the common Ground-type. Its ability Gale Wings allows Talonflame to hit faster threats with its Flying-type STAB move before being hit in return, letting it deal great damage to common Choice Scarf users such as Krookodile and Hydreigon with Brave Bird or a Supersonic Skystrike if Gale Wings hasn't been broken.", "Swalot": "Despite its solid coverage and bulk, Swalot is outclassed by Muk and Roselia as a special wall. Muk has higher offensive stats and special bulk, while Roselia has access to reliable recovery and Spikes. Swalot also competes with Eelektross as an Assault Vest user due to its ability to pivot with Volt Switch and competes with Skuntank as an offensive Poison-type due to its secondary Dark typing. Furthermore, Swalot's offensive stats are below average, limiting its offensive capabilities. Swalot is taken advantage of easily by Pokemon such as Regirock that can set Stealth Rock on it, and Swalot is worn down easily by entry hazards due to its lack of recovery.", "Zygarde": "Spread attacks are extremely valuable in Doubles, and Zygarde possesses a fantastic one in Thousand Arrows, which allows it to hit even Flying-types and Levitate users with its Ground-type STAB attack. This leaves Zygarde with only a few Pokemon that can reliably take its attacks due to many otherwise resistant Bug- and Grass-types having a secondary typing weak to Ground. With such a fantastic spread move in its arsenal, Zygarde makes a great user of either Dragon Dance or Choice Band sets, with the former taking advantage of the strong spread damage to clean the opposition and the latter using Zygarde's tendency to need only Thousand Arrows for damage to its advantage. Zygarde's offensive stats aren't anything overly impressive, but its bulk provides it many chances to get attacks off or boost up with Dragon Dance, and access to Extreme Speed weakens the impact its mediocre Speed would otherwise have on its effectiveness. However, with an already average Attack stat and a primary STAB attack weakened by nature of being a spread move, Zygarde's damage output is quite dependent on it avoiding Intimidate, a difficult task with most teams carrying threats with that ability.", "Inkay": "Inkay's ability, Contrary, in combination with the move Superpower allows it to perform as quite a unique sweeper that is able to boost its stats and deal damage at the same time. Furthermore, it has access to STAB Knock Off, allowing it to cripple defensive walls easily, and gets perfect coverage with the aforementioned two moves and Psycho Cut. Inkay has access to some interesting utility options such as Switcheroo and Trick Room as well. However, its 4x weakness to Bug-type moves such as U-turn makes it easy to force out by some of the most common Pokemon in the metagame, mainly Mienfoo and Vullaby. Inkay's lack of reliable recovery and poor base stats make it hard for it to switch into many attacks and remain healthy throughout a match. Inkay's low Speed also forces it to use a Choice Scarf, limiting its use of coverage and STAB options.", "Meganium": "Meganium simply has no real use over other bulky Grass-types in the tier. Its abilities are useless, it has a mediocre movepool, it is very passive, and its bulk isn't even that impressive. Meganium does have some unique moves among its brethren like Dragon Tail and Aromatherapy, but otherwise you're simply better off using other defensive Grass-types such as Tangela, Roselia, and Cradily, which have better utility overall. As a cleric, Audino, Articuno, and even Granbull are better choices due to their superior bulk and movepools.", "Monferno": null, "Mr. Mime": "Mr. Mime possesses a notable niche over other Psychic-types like Mesprit and Jynx thanks to its secondary Fairy typing. Its Nasty Plot set works well against balance and stall teams by breaking through walls and hitting surprisingly hard with its perfect neutral coverage. Its coverage and Speed tier allow Mr. Mime to do well versus offensive teams, especially in a tier full of Fighting-types. Its Fairy typing also helps it serve as a reliable check to threatening Dragon-types in the tier like Drampa and Alolan Exeggutor. However, although Mr. Mime's Speed is slightly above average, it is slow enough to be scared out by faster Pokemon due to its poor physical bulk and HP. Its defenses also leave it susceptible to priority moves and Pursuit trapping, which can make it hard to use. While its Fairy typing can lend a hand in checking Fighting-types more easily, Mr. Mime still faces a lot of competition from fellow Psychic-type Jynx, which is often more of an offensive threat thanks to its slightly higher Speed and Ice coverage.", "Zeraora": "Zeraora is a potent offensive threat in UU by virtue of its decent mixed offenses, outstanding Speed, and access to a powerful physical Electric-type move in Plasma Fists. Thanks to its aforementioned Speed, it can outrun and threaten some of the tier's fastest threats, including Mega Manectric, Latias, Gengar, and Starmie. Its vast coverage movepool allows it to hit several conventional Electric-type checks like Hydreigon and Hippowdon with moves like Close Combat and Grass Knot, making it a solid mixed wallbreaker. It can also attempt to sweep with Bulk Up thanks to its ability to power through several bulkier threats with either Gigavolt Havoc or Breakneck Blitz, as well as its Speed allowing it to limit the number of Pokemon capable of revenge killing it. Unfortunately, Zeraora's pitiful defenses and weak typing limit its opportunities to come into play on its own and prevent it from reliably checking Pokemon that other Electric-types can often handle well, such as Scizor and Togekiss. Its lack of immediate power causes it to rely on Life Orb for damage output on some sets, damaging its longevity in the process. This also makes Zeraora more prediction reliant in order to adequately punish its switch-ins. Zeraora struggles to fit all of its desired coverage moves on its setup sets, meaning that they will always fail to hit at least one key target hard. Because of these downsides, Zeraora faces competition from other Electric-types like Rotom-H and Mega Manectric, which can more reliably fulfill their roles due to being less hard pressed to fit coverage on their sets and having better defensive utility.", "Barbaracle": "Barbaracle has carved itself a niche in the UnderUsed metagame as a potent Shell Smash sweeper due to its access to Liquidation and ability to viably run Rockium Z. Most teams are easily swept due to lack of preparation for Barbaracle, as they usually only have a couple decent checks for it and are more often than not unable to prevent it from gaining a good setup opportunity thanks to its great Defense and strong offensive typing. Barbaracle is also one of the tier's better stallbreakers, thanks to its ability to be a boosting Pokemon that can break past most of stall's typical answers like Quagsire. However, while Barbaracle is generally effective against most playstyles, it tends to struggle against most matchups where the opponent has one or two strong checks to Barbaracle and thus can dissuade it from ever setting up a Shell Smash. Furthermore, Barbaracle is a one-trick pony and requires its teammates to cater to it in order to function successfully in the tier. This reliance on being built around as well as its reliance on Shell Smash in order to become a potent threat make Barbaracle a rather mediocre option when compared to other setup sweepers with more overall utility like Azumarill and Scizor.", "Wailord": "Wailord finds its only niche in the PU metagame by PP stalling with Pressure and is otherwise outclassed by other Water-type pokemon like Jellicent and Floatzel that provide much better offensive utility. Wailord may possess a colossal HP stat, but this is offset by its meager defenses. This means it often finds itself unable to switch in well against a lot of strong wallbreakers such as Stoutland and Aggron and is setup bait for Pokemon like Leafeon and Dodrio. As a defensive Water-type, it is again outclassed by Jellicent, which provides a better defensive typing, an immunity to Water, and access to Will-O-Wisp to cripple physical attackers such as Crabominable. Wailord only warrants use on stall teams, but even on stall, Pyukumuku does a better job stalling than Wailord, since it can live longer and has a better recovery move in Recover.", "Yveltal": null, "Nihilego": "By virtue of its unique typing, great Special Attack and Speed, and vast movepool with coverage and utility, Nihilego carves a niche for itself in UU as a customizable offensive force whose tools can be tailored to its team's needs. Its access to Stealth Rock and Toxic Spikes can allow it to function as a reliable offensive entry hazard setter, using its typing and coverage to threaten out many common entry hazard removers, though it also has the option of running moves such as Protect and Acid Spray to more easily work around its checks. Thanks to its typing, coverage, and Speed, Nihilego can also utilize Choice Scarf to revenge kill several of the tier's threatening forces, such as Mega Aerodactyl, Mega Altaria, Terrakion, and Celebi. Moreover, its excellent special bulk for an offensive Pokemon can allow it to sponge weaker or resisted special attacks well, take on Flying-types like Moltres and Togekiss, and blanket check foes like Gengar, Mega Manectric, and Choice Scarf Hydreigon if need be. Unfortunately, Nihilego is at times held back by its terrible physical bulk, which allows the tier's several faster physical threats, including Cobalion and Zeraora, to easily take advantage of it. This also leaves it vulnerable to Pursuit and powerful priority attacks, most notably Scizor's Bullet Punch. It's also unable to power through the tier's surplus of Ground- and Steel-types with its STAB moves alone, which allows most to tank a hit and KO Nihilego with super effective attacks. Nihilego can also struggle to break through a few key defensive Pokemon in the metagame, such as Blissey, Mega Steelix, and Gligar, compromising its wallbreaking capabilities. Lastly, while Nihilego's Speed and typing provide plentiful perks, they also leave it outrun and overwhelmed by a few tier staples, such as Terrakion, Latias, and Cobalion.", "Simisear": "Simisear is a niche sweeper that differentiates itself with its rare access to Fire-type STAB moves and decent coverage, along with Nasty Plot and a solid Speed tier. It can utilize various Z-Moves to break through would-be checks such as Lanturn and Audino, which makes it more threatening and unpredictable. However, Simisear's paltry defenses and weakness to Stealth Rock leave it open to Choice Scarf users like Primeape, Aurorus, and Swanna, along with certain forms of priority like Kabutops's Aqua Jet and Skuntank's Sucker Punch. Its meager bulk also makes it more difficult to set up a Nasty Plot, which is necessary to patch up Simisear's low damage output so that it can threaten defensive switch-ins more easily. Combusken and Turtonator are other options that give Simisear competition as Fire-type breakers, with Combusken being capable of cleaning with Speed Boost, Turtonator being able to more easily set up with its bulk, and both wielding an additional STAB type.", "Mienfoo": "Mienfoo has a variety of traits that make it one of the best all-around Pokemon in the metagame. Its terrific stat distribution and deep movepool, which includes utility moves such as Knock Off and U-turn and coverage moves such as Poison Jab and Acrobatics, give it the ability to function in a variety of roles, freely customizing its item, EV spread, and choice of moves for the team it is on. Because of its various roles, Mienfoo is quite versatile and difficult to check until its set is revealed. Mienfoo's most common role is that of a pivot, using its good natural bulk, access to U-turn, and Regenerator ability to take a wide range of hits and then bring in a teammate, granting its team momentum instantly while gaining a third of its HP back just by pivoting out. It can also support its team through the use of Knock Off, which removes common defensive items such as Eviolite and Berry Juice to support Mienfoo's teammates. However, Mienfoo is not limited to functioning as a bulky pivot, as it is also able to invest in its Attack and don a Choice Scarf to function as a threatening cleaner in the late-game. In short, Mienfoo's longevity thanks to Regenerator, ability to pivot and support its teammates with U-turn and Knock Off, good stat distribution, and wide support and coverage movepool make it incredibly splashable and an excellent choice on many teams. Mienfoo's only downside is its own popularity; despite its ability to perform many roles, Mienfoo is pretty consistently defeated by the same Pokemon, including Spritzee, Snubbull, and Foongus, which tend to be quite common because of how prevalent it is.", "Wormadam": "Wormadam is a terrible and completely outclassed Quiver Dance user. Bellossom overwhelmingly outclasses it due to its amazing utility move Strength Sap while being a far bulkier user of Quiver Dance. Wormadam also has an atrocious defensive typing that gets it annihilated by every Flying-, Fire-, and Poison-type in the tier like Dodrio, Swanna, Combusken, Simisear, and Skuntank. It doesn\u2019t help Wormadam either that it\u2019s weak to entry hazards and easily gets revenge killed even after one boost by Pokemon as slow as Stoutland, Kangaskhan, and Rotom-F.", "Shelmet": "Shelmet is set apart from other Spikes setters in the tier due to its good bulk and access to both Recover and a slow Baton Pass, allowing it to set up multiple layers of Spikes throughout the match and sponge a hit to bring a teammate in safely. It can also switch in on powder moves such as Foongus's Spore thanks to its access to Overcoat, giving it more opportunities to switch in. However, Shelmet has a small movepool and is often rendered setup bait due to its passivity and weak offenses. Its poor offensive presence means it cannot outdamage spinners and loses to them. Though its typing makes it resist the STAB moves of common Fighting-types, Shelmet cannot do much back to them, as they resist its attacks, and some of these Pokemon such as Timburr and Croagunk can still use Shelmet as setup bait if carrying a boosting move. Furthermore, Shelmet is weak to common Flying-types like Vullaby and Doduo, as well as the omnipresent Stealth Rock, forcing it to lose a quarter of its health as it switches in. While Shelmet's lack of Speed does help with bringing teammates in safely with Baton Pass, it also makes it more susceptible to Taunt from the likes of Mienfoo and Onix. Lastly, Shelmet faces competition with other entry hazard setters such as Ferroseed, Onix, and Dwebble due to them being more reliable.", "Elekid": "Elekid is one of the fastest Pokemon in LC, with an amazing 20 Speed as its most remarkable feature. It also has good Attack and Special Attack base stats, which can make Elekid an strong offensive presence, with good STAB moves like Thunderbolt and Volt Switch and coverage options like Psychic, Cross Chop, and Fire Punch in its arsenal. Sadly, Elekid doesn't have much going for it defensively, which means it faces competition from similar Electric-type attackers Magnemite and Chinchou. As a frail attacker, Elekid's role is straightforward, but it relies on outspeeding and KOing its foes, which it sometimes struggles with due to its decent but not stellar attacking stats, especially when facing Ground-types.", "Ribombee": null, "Ursaring": "A monstrous base Attack stat of 130, access to Swords Dance, and a powerful ability in Guts make Ursaring a force to be reckoned with as a physical wallbreaker. This, combined with its fairly low Speed, makes it a near mandatory member for Trick Room teams as a wallbreaker, making it easier for teammates to clean up. Its bulk is good enough so that it isn't too threatened by priority outside of Mach Punch. However, Ursaring's Speed and mediocre bulk mean that, outside of Trick Room, it's very vulnerable to faster attackers. It also faces competition from other physical Normal-types such as Kangaskhan and Zangoose, which fit on more common playstyles, while Ursaring is usually dedicated to only Trick Room. While it does have a large number of coverage moves, Ursaring finds itself very predictable because it generally chooses the same moves for any set.", "Anorith": "Anorith's access to Knock Off, Stealth Rock, and Rapid Spin gives it excellent role compression to support the team with. Its great 18 Speed tier makes it the second fastest Stealth Rock user in the tier, only behind Diglett. It also has an excellent Attack stat, one of the highest in the metagame, so it can hit quite hard. However, Anorith faces competition from Onix and Dwebble as an entry hazard setter and from Drilbur and Staryu as a spinner due to their greater reliability. Anorith is also pretty frail, with a very bad defensive typing that only gives it a resistance to two uncommon offensive typings and a weakness to Aqua Jet, Bullet Punch, and Stealth Rock, making it hard to switch in and remove entry hazards. Anorith also has trouble dealing with the common Fighting-types due to its small movepool, and it's completely countered by Staryu because it can KO Anorith before it can move and then remove its entry hazards with Rapid Spin.", "Tyrantrum": "Tyrantrum's most defining trait is its access to Rock Head and STAB Head Smash, giving it an absurdly powerful attack with no immediate drawbacks that dents any Pokemon that does not resist it and lets it act as a powerful holepuncher or cleaner. Rock is a powerful offensive typing, granting Tyrantrum good coverage against a majority of the tier and making Head Smash quite spammable. Tyrantrum has good neutral coverage and a considerably wide movepool, although all it really needs are moves that take on the few Pokemon in the tier that can consistently withstand its Head Smashes. These qualities present Tyrantrum as one of the tier's most potent attackers and holepunchers. However, Tyrantrum's Speed is noticeably lacking, and as a Choice Scarf user, it suffers from being unable to outspeed +1 Feraligatr. Tyrantrum's low Special Defense combined with its awkward defensive typing and multitude of weaknesses often turns it into a defensive liability, making Tyrantrum function as a glass cannon. Tyrantrum is thus heavily reliant on its few physical resistances and 4x resistance to Fire to avoid getting 2HKOed by invested attacks.", "Gardevoir": "Gardevoir's high Special Attack stat and good offensive typing of Psychic / Fairy make it a hard Pokemon to switch into, especially for teams that use less sturdy Fairy checks such as Forretress and Steelix as their sole Steel-type. In addition to its main attacking moves, Gardevoir gets access to useful support moves, mainly Healing Wish. Moreover, Trace is a great ability on Gardevoir, as it can copy useful abilities such as Levitate from Flygon, and Regenerator from Slowbro. However, it has pitiful Defense, which makes it revenge killed quite easily and 2HKOed by most neutral hits. Although it outspeeds most bulkier Pokemon, there are faster Choice Scarf users in the tier, such as Flygon, and its unboosted Speed stat makes it slower than most offensive Pokemon. Setup sweepers such as Barbaracle and Dragon Dance Zygarde-10% are also faster than Choice Scarf Gardevoir after boosting, making it imperfect at revenge killing.", "Tynamo": null, "Combee": null, "Krokorok": null, "Stunfisk": "A decent and unique defensive typing along with fairly good stats allows Stunfisk to act as a check to several offensive threats like Skuntank, Dodrio, Lycanroc, Aggron, and Scyther. Access to Stealth Rock allows Stunfisk to also provide entry hazard support, slowly chipping away at the opposing team. Static is also a good ability for a defensive Pokemon, spreading paralysis to further help out teammates. However, lack of reliable recovery is unhelpful for a defensive Pokemon like Stunfisk and leaves it open to being worn down quickly by status and chip damage. Its typing, while being great for checking many physical threats, unfortunately leaves Stunfisk weak to predominately specially based types like Ice, Grass, and Water from Pokemon such as Jellicent and Aurorus as well as giving it a weakness to Earthquake and other Ground-type attacks including those from the likes of Mudsdale and Kangaskhan. Stunfisk also faces heavy competition from other Stealth Rock setters, mainly Mudsdale, which can check most of the same Pokemon and has better overall utility.", "Mewtwo": null, "Tranquill": null, "Riolu": "Riolu's niche over Little Cup's other Fighting-types lies in its access to Copycat and Prankster. This allows Riolu to gain priority on its most recently used attack with Copycat and beat faster Pokemon that would otherwise threaten it such as Diglett, Doduo, and Gastly. Furthermore, Riolu's expansive movepool, fair bulk with Eviolite, high Attack stat, and access to Swords Dance altogether allow it to function as a fairly potent sweeper. Unfortunately, Riolu's lack of Knock Off and a more reliable STAB attack than High Jump Kick, as well as worse bulk than most other Fighting-types still leave it generally outclassed by better options in Mienfoo and Timburr. It also struggles to find setup opportunities due to its only decent bulk as well as rather unimpressive Speed, and it can at times, struggle to maintain Copycat chains due to the tier's prevalence of priority.", "Combusken": "Combusken sports a number of positives that separate it from the myriad of sweepers and cleaners in the tier. For starters, it has a solid and uncommon ability in Speed Boost, which helps make it outspeed and KO everything left on the opposing team without the need to manually boost its Speed. Combusken is always able to at least grab one boost due to Protect. Secondly, its typing is really solid offensively, as its STAB moves alone hit the entire tier, barring a few Pokemon, for neutral damage, and it can beat traditional Fighting-type checks like Gourgeist-XL, Sableye, and Weezing due to its Fire typing and strong physical or special Inferno Overdrives. Its offenses aren't the best, though, and as a result, it struggles with breaking through bulkier Pokemon, but access to high-powered STAB moves in Fire Blast, Flare Blitz, and Focus Blast as well as Z-Moves helps to mitigate this. Combusken's other stats are below average, as well. It's rather frail, which makes revenge killing it with priority easier, and a low base Speed of 55 leaves it outsped by common Choice Scarf users like Oricorio-G even at +2.", "Drilbur": "Drilbur can fulfill several different roles in the LC metagame and thus fits on offensive and balanced teams alike. Its moderate bulk with an Eviolite or Berry Juice allows it to also make use of its good utility movepool to set up entry hazards, remove them, and provide its team with speed control. Its high Attack and Speed stats alongside an amazing offensive typing allow it to use powerful Swords Dance-boosted moves like STAB Earthquake, Rock Slide, and Shadow Claw to punch holes in opposing teams. Drilbur also has an extremely useful ability in Mold Breaker, which allows it to ignore abilities like Sturdy and Levitate to easily defeat the likes of Gastly and Onix. However, despite its perks, Drilbur is rather frail even with an Eviolite and can thus be overwhelmed in trying to accomplish its roles by powerful offensive threats, such as Rufflet, Doduo, and Abra. Drilbur also has a poor defensive typing, with weaknesses to the tier's common Grass-, Water-, and Ice-type attacks and to common priority moves in Aqua Jet from Corphish and Ice Shard from Snover. Drilbur also struggles to deal with some of the tier's Ghost-types that prevent it from using Rapid Spin, as Pumpkaboo-XL resists its STAB attacks and Frillish can threaten it with powerful Water-type STAB attacks. Lastly, Drilbur struggles in that at times it faces stiff offensive competition from Mudbray, which is stronger, has a better ability, and has better coverage.", "Scatterbug": null, "Castform": "Castform may have a wide variety of support and coverage moves at its disposal, but it lacks the stats to utilize them properly. Worse still, it relies on having the right weather up to even get STAB on a lot of these moves, meaning it has no breaking power outside of weather, and thanks to its weak offensive stats, it still hits like a wet paper bag even with weather up. Its low Speed tier and lack of a Speed-boosting ability means it's easily revenge-killed. Please refrain from using Castform on any serious team and just use Ludicolo instead.", "Fomantis": "Almost everything Fomantis can do, Snivy can do better. The two Pokemon both have similar movepools and abilities, but Fomantis has much worse stats than Snivy and lacks access to certain useful moves like Glare and Knock Off. Even if Snivy weren\u2019t useful, however, Fomantis would still be hindered by its awful typing and stats, which prevent it from ever being viable. While it can run a full physical set, which gives it a tiny bit of a niche over Snivy, its lack of power makes such a set not worth using.", "Spinda": "Spinda's atrocious base 60 stats across the board and bland Normal-typing mean that no matter what it tries to do, it will always be outdone by another Normal-type Pokemon such as Ursaring or Audino.", "Cradily": "Cradily is a fairly niche defensive Stealth Rock setter that manages to set itself apart with unique resistances and immunities. Its good bulk and access to reliable recovery allow it to consistently set up Stealth Rock multiple times in a match while checking strong threats such as Kangaskhan. Cradily's unique type combination and access to Storm Drain give it useful immunities and resistances to Water, Normal, and Electric, allowing it to check Pokemon such as Floatzel, Pyroar, and Eelektross. However, Cradily is highly susceptible to common Ice- and Fighting-types such as Aurorus and Primeape. Additionally, many Water- and Normal-types pack Ice- or Fighting-type coverage, meaning Cradily is not a reliable counter to Pokemon such as Kingler and Zangoose. Base 81 offenses make Cradily unable to do much damage against anything that resists its STAB moves, forcing it to rely on badly poisoning them with Toxic. It is terribly slow and thus usually forced to take two hits when switching in, limiting its ability to switch into strong hits and set up Stealth Rock. Being passive can also invite setup sweepers that are not worried about Toxic such as Gurdurr and Oricorio-G. All of these flaws mean that Cradily faces severe competition from other Stealth Rock setters such as Torterra and Regirock.", "Pidgeot": "Mega Pidgeot's great Speed tier, amazing offensive typing in Flying, and solid Special Attack make it a threatening attacker. No Guard gives Mega Pidgeot a 100% accurate Hurricane, which means it has something many special attacking Flying-types lack: a reliable, strong STAB move. Flying as an offensive typing is great, as few types resist it, although the types it hits super effectively are not very common. Mega Pidgeot also has solid coverage in Heat Wave, pivoting abilities in U-turn, and reliable recovery in Roost, giving it decent longevity and allowing it to fit on VoltTurn teams. Mega Pidgeot's flaws lie in its mediocre defensive typing, giving it very few useful resistances and a crippling weakness to Stealth Rock; its bulk is good enough to survive most neutral attacks, but not with Stealth Rock up, making entry hazard removal a priority on Mega Pidgeot teams. The high usage of Electric-types such as Mega Manectric do Mega Pidgeot no favors either, as they resist its STAB attack and deal heavy damage in return with Volt Switch or OHKO with Thunderbolt. While No Guard gives Mega Pidgeot an accurate Hurricane, it also makes every inaccurate move hit Mega Pidgeot itself, which means it cannot dodge moves such as Stone Edge, Toxic, and Icicle Crash. It also faces indirect competition from other Mega Evolutions, such as Mega Aerodactyl and Mega Sharpedo, which are often faster and stronger than Mega Pidgeot.", "Trumbeak": null, "Kingler": null, "Exeggcute": "Exeggcute has some potential as a support Pokemon in the LC metagame thanks to its great physical bulk and decent support movepool, which contains options such as Sleep Powder and Stun Spore. Its ability Harvest gives Exeggcute access to passive recovery when paired with an Oran Berry as long as Exeggcute is not hit by Knock Off. However, Exeggcute's typing, while not awful, leaves it vulnerable to a plethora of LC's most common attacking moves, such as U-turn, Knock Off, and Flying-type attacks. Due to its typing, Exeggcute usually will fail to check the physical attackers it aims to check because they carry a super effective coverage move. Exeggcute is further held back by poor Speed and Special Defense, which couple to make it easily taken out by special attackers. Finally, Exeggcute often relies on putting Pokemon to sleep to set up Substitute, which leaves it extremely reliant on Sleep Powder's relatively low accuracy. Due to these flaws, it is usually difficult to justify using Exeggcute over Foongus, which has a better typing, comparable bulk, and a more accurate sleep-inducing move. Exeggcute's niche lies in its good Defense stat, a resistance to common Ground-type attacks, and passive recovery.", "Klefki": "Klefki's massive utility movepool alongside its Prankster ability makes it a premier support Pokemon in the UU metagame and the best user of Spikes by far. Its amazing defensive typing alongside access to moves like Thunder Wave and Magnet Rise allows it to very adequately check top-tier threats, such as Mega Aerodactyl, Latias, Mega Beedrill, and Hydreigon. Klefki also possesses a lot of flexibility in terms of which moves it can opt to run, which, alongside its ability to set up Spikes, allows it to fit very comfortably on offensive and balanced teams alike. Unfortunately, Klefki lacks recovery, which in tandem with its subpar bulk leaves it prone to being worn down, thus preventing it from reliably checking foes it aims to check from time to time. Klefki also lacks an offensive presence, which leaves it reliant on hitting foes super effectively to avoid being too passive.", "Lunatone": "Lunatone is hard to justify on teams, as it is outclassed completely by Mesprit, which possesses greater bulk, greater speed, a better defensive typing, and overall greater utility on teams. Lunatone's only niche is to attempt to sweep using Rock Polish to outspeed most Pokemon in the tier, but unfortunately, Lunatone faces major competition from Omastar as a setup sweeper due to Omastar dealing much more damage than Lunatone. Lunatone's typing hinders it greatly, as it is weak to common typings such as Dark, Water, and Bug and is susceptible to priority such as Sucker Punch from Pokemon like Skuntank. Furthermore, Lunatone is quite slow before a Rock Polish, and common offensive Pokemon in the tier such as Primeape, Lilligant and Kabutops are able to outspeed it and take it out with ease, giving it a hard time actually setting up Rock Polish. Lunatone finds itself lacking the power to hit bulkier opposing Pokemon such as Eelektross and Alolan Exeggutor, and these Pokemon are able to whittle it down with their STAB moves.", "Swampert": "Offensively, Swampert is the premier Mega Evolution choice on rain teams because of its Electric immunity. It also has the ability to break down conventional rain checks such as Toxapex, Ferrothorn, and Mantine due to its secondary STAB attack, Earthquake, and its array of coverage moves such as Superpower and Stone Edge. Mega Swampert can also provide great role compression because it is a Stealth Rock user that beats Mega Sableye. Defensively, Mega Swampert opens holes to Pokemon rain is already weak to, most notably Ash-Greninja and Keldeo. Mega Swampert suffers the same problem with other bulky physical attackers, as it is prone to chip damage from Rocky Helmet, Rough Skin, and Iron Barbs, meaning its bulk sometimes cannot be used practically. Mega Swampert is also dependent on rain to function, meaning it can only be used effectively when rain is active.", "Vanillite": "Vanillite has a decent Special Attack stat and ways of boosting its Speed, but its bad defensive typing, shallow movepool, and poor bulk make it very underwhelming. Vullaby, Clamperl, and Shellder are better Speed-boosting sweepers than Vanillite, while Amaura, Alolan Vulpix, and Alolan Sandshrew are better Ice-types. Because a variety of more viable Pokemon directly outclass Vanillite, it should not be considered for serious teams.", "Rapidash": "Rapidash is a poor Fire-type for a team. It is a utility attacker with decent coverage and Will-O-Wisp. Sadly, Rapidash is outclassed by Combusken, which has access to Speed Boost and Swords Dance and a better dual STAB typing. It also has a weakness to entry hazards such as Stealth Rock and Spikes and suffers recoil from its moves. While it has a great Speed tier, it has a subpar Attack and a movepool that hurts more than it helps.", "Lairon": null, "Ho-Oh": null, "Krabby": "Krabby seems appealing due to its high Attack stat, usable Speed, and good ability in Sheer Force, allowing it to be a strong cleaner. However, it faces stiff competition from other physical Water-types in the tier such as Corphish and Totodile, as they have better movepools including ways to boost both Speed and Attack in Dragon Dance and a priority option in Aqua Jet, both of which Krabby lacks. These Pokemon also have better bulk, giving them an easier time setting up than Krabby, whose poor Special Defense grants it limited setup opportunities. This forces it to opt for a Choice Scarf revenge killer set to differentiate itself, which does not have a serious niche due to the limited value of Water as its sole STAB attacking type.", "Electivire": "Electivire is a mixed wallbreaker with great coverage options and a Speed tier that permits it to outspeed and revenge kill common slower wallbreakers like Omastar, Oricorio-G, and Aurorus. Since there are so many different possibilities in terms of sets and coverage moves, Electivire can be unpredictable, though many of its options aren't usually as viable. Despite its offensive prowess, its frailty and middling Speed make it susceptible to faster attackers such as Lycanroc, Choice Scarf users like Primeape and Togedemaru, and priority moves such as Zangoose's Quick Attack and Skuntank's Sucker Punch. Regardless of its tremendous Attack, it struggles to break through physical walls, thus forcing it to rely on its weaker Special Attack in some cases. Since its Special Attack is nothing to write home about, it relies on super effective moves specifically designed to break its checks, thus failing to handle those neutral to its attacks such as Clefairy and defensive Spiritomb. It also faces harsh competition from fellow Electric-types, the most noteworthy being Eelektross, which totally eclipses Electivire besides having much lower Speed and lacking niche coverage moves like Earthquake. Other arguably better Electric-types include Alolan Raichu, which can break down its counters with Nasty Plot boosts, and Togedemaru, which can check Clefairy and can outpace base 95s that Electivire runs the risk of having to Speed tie with such as Haunter and Jynx.", "Suicune": "Suicune is a great setup sweeper thanks to its solid defensive typing and natural bulk, which also allows it to check prominent threats such as Scizor and Mega Aerodactyl. Furthermore, with access to both Rest and Calm Mind, Suicune can also function as a fairly sustainable bulky sweeper. Because of its ability, Pressure, and its potential to set up fairly easily, Suicune is able to threaten defensive teams a lot. Pressure also allows it to break through certain Pokemon that would normally check it, such as Volcanion. Suicune also has a very decent base Speed stat for a bulky Pokemon, allowing it to hit or set up against Pokemon like Mamoswine and Togekiss. However, since it doesn't have access to reliable recovery, Suicune is forced to rely on Leftovers or Rest in order to stay healthy. It's also held back by its weakness to Electric and Grass, which are common typings, making it easily exploitable by Pokemon like Mega Manectric and Celebi.", "Seadra": null, "Tirtouga": "Tirtouga's typing, abilities, and stats allow it to perform both offensive and defensive roles well in the Little Cup metagame. Its access to Shell Smash, two great abilities in Sturdy and Solid Rock, powerful STAB moves in Stone Edge and Waterfall, STAB priority in Aqua Jet, and good coverage options in Zen Headbutt and Earthquake can turn Tirtouga into a strong late-game sweeper, while its Rock / Water typing, great defensive ability Solid Rock, and high Defense stat also allows it to check many prominent threats in the metagame such as Doduo, Rufflet, Vullaby, Pawniard, and Ponyta. In addition, Tirtouga can also support its team with moves like Stealth Rock and Knock Off; however, Tirtouga's offensive sets struggle because of its very low Speed stat, meaning it can be revenge killed by faster Choice Scarf users such as Mienfoo and Chinchou. It's also weak to common priority moves in Mach Punch and Vacuum Wave, making it even easier to revenge kill after lowering its defenses with Shell Smash. On the defensive side, Tirtouga lacks recovery, meaning it is prone to being worn down. It also has a big weakness to common Grass-types such as Snivy, Pumpkaboo-XL, and Cottonee.", "Slugma": "Slugma might seem appealing due to its ability to spread burns and prevent setup with Memento, but it's not very good at this role due to its poor bulk, low Speed, and common weaknesses to Rock and Ground. Outside of its access to Memento and Clear Smog to stop setup, it's completely outclassed by both Ponyta and Larvesta, as they both can use their superior base stats to spread burns more effectively.", "Hoppip": "Though it has an interesting typing and movepool, Hoppip's stats are far too low for it to have any sort of competitive niche. Its awful Attack and average Speed stats cause it to be unable to seriously threaten the opponent with its offensive movepool, while its poor bulk negates any defensive advantages its typing might offer. As a result, Hoppip is not worth including on a competitive team.", "Tornadus": "Tornadus is a versatile offensive Pokemon that can function as a wallbreaker with its solid power and coverage or as a utility pivot with U-turn and Prankster status moves like Defog and Tailwind. Its high Special Attack and high Speed allow it to outspeed several prominent threats in UU, including Kommo-o, Celebi, and Infernape, and overpower them with STAB Hurricane. It also can utilize Supersonic Skystrike to even break past bulkier offensive threats like Latias and Terrakion after minor chip damage. This middle ground of power and Speed allows it to distinguish itself from other Flying-type choices. Its large range of coverage options also benefits it, allowing it to utilize moves like Superpower and Heat Wave to greatly limit its switch-ins. Unfortunately, Tornadus provides very little defensive utility to teams due to its Stealth Rock weakness, lack of recovery, mediocre defenses, and lack of useful resistances. Because of this, it faces competition from other offensive Flying-types such as Moltres, Mega Pidgeot, and Togekiss, which have better defensive typings, better bulk, and access to reliable recovery. Its reliance on Hurricane as its STAB attack can be disadvantageous due to the move's poor accuracy. Lastly, due to Tornadus's poor defenses and typing, it struggles to do anything of worth to most priority users like Mamoswine and Scizor, as they can power through it easily after minor chip damage.", "Metang": "Metang is a solid pick for a Stealth Rock setter, with its main attribute being its great defensive typing that allows it to serve as a decent check for various relevant threats such as Jynx, Stoutland, Aurorus, and Dodrio. However, it is very reliant on its Eviolite to shore up its only average defenses. The rest of Metang's stats are mediocre, with its somewhat underwhelming Attack and low Speed leaving it with little offensive presence against foes it does not have coverage for. Metang's lack of recovery causes it to be worn down easily, which limits its ability to switch into multiple foes throughout the match. This is furthered by Metang's weakness to common coverage moves from various Pokemon it switches into such as Kangaskhan's Earthquake and Aurorus's Earth Power. Finally, Metang faces competition as a Stealth Rock setter from Pokemon like Regirock, Mudsdale, and Alolan Sandslash, which all have various unique attributes and don't depend on Eviolite for their bulk, allowing them to run other items like Leftovers.", "Gastrodon": "Gastrodon is one of PU's most solid defensive threats thanks to its amazing defensive typing, ability, and access to reliable recovery. This allows it to check common threats such as Lycanroc, Aggron, and Choice Specs Jellicent and block Volt Switch from the likes of Lanturn. However, its typing also leaves it weak to rather common Grass-types such as Lilligant and Victreebel. Pokemon that run Grass-type coverage such as Eelektross and Simisear and other threats that don't always run Grass-type coverage such as Lanturn and Floatzel can also lure in Gastrodon and beat it. It also suffers from being passive and lets threats such as Drampa and the aforementioned Lilligant in almost for free, as they only fear a potential Toxic. Furthermore, Gastrodon is extremely prone to getting worn down via Toxic, forcing it to use Recover more often. Finally, Gastrodon suffers from competition from Quagsire, as it has an arguably better defensive ability in Unaware, which allows it to better check Lycanroc and threats Gastrodon is unable to such as Gurdurr, and isn't as passive due to its higher Attack.", "Gloom": null, "Natu": "Natu carves itself a niche as the only Magic Bounce user in the tier, making it function as a great entry hazard and status deterrent for both offensive and defensive teams alike. It boasts a wide movepool with access to Roost, U-turn, and Thunder Wave for utility purposes and coverage options like Heat Wave, Sucker Punch, and Giga Drain. Furthermore, it has decent Special Attack when invested and hits a respectable 17 Speed, giving it some offensive presence. Natu also has a good typing, granting an immunity to Ground and a 4x resistance to Fighting, and this typing paired with its movepool and Magic Bounce ability allows it to counter key defensive Pokemon like Foongus and Ferroseed. However, its typing leaves it easily trapped by Pursuit and weak to Knock Off, which are carried by many Fighting-types it would otherwise check. Additionally, because of Natu's many weaknesses, it often loses to common entry hazard setters such as Onix, Dwebble, and Pawniard due to their Rock- or Dark-type moves as well as faster Pokemon such as Staryu and Doduo due to their coverage options. Lastly, even after investment, Natu has mediocre bulk, making it hard for Natu to take stronger attacks.", "Carnivine": "Despite being a strong physical Grass-type, Carnivine finds itself hopelessly outclassed by other Grass-types mostly due to its terrible Speed as well as its mediocre defenses, which make it troublesome to consistently wallbreak. There is little point in using Carnivine over other superior Grass-types like Lilligant, Abomasnow, Leafeon, and Shiftry, whose superior typings, stats, and coverage allow them to break through defensive cores with ease. Additionally, Grass-type checks are common in PU due to the high number of powerful Grass-types in the tier.", "Shaymin": "Shaymin's well-rounded stats, ability to run a variety of sets, and absurdly powerful signature move in Seed Flare make it a big threat in the RU metagame. Its extensive movepool including recovery in Synthesis and Leech Seed, utility in Healing Wish, and a plethora of coverage options such as Psychic, Earth Power, and Dazzling Gleam makes it difficult to check. Seed Flare's large chance to lower the foe's Special Defense allows Shaymin to easily pressure bulkier threats that would typically check it such as Snorlax and Cresselia. Shaymin's access to Natural Cure and recovery allows it to pressure defensive teams even more. Due to its very good bulk for an offensive Pokemon, it is able to fit seamlessly onto offensive teams and check Water- and Ground-types such as Feraligatr, Milotic, and Rhyperior. Natural Cure also allows it to absorb crippling status ailments such as poison and burn for its teammates. However, Shaymin's Seed Flare suffers from low accuracy and is easily PP stalled, and Shaymin lacks the power to break through bulky teams without getting Special Defense drops from Seed Flare. Shaymin also has difficulty fitting the coverage it needs and recovery all onto one set. Finally, despite its decent Speed, it is outsped and revenge killed by common threats such as Salazzle and Noivern.", "Tyranitar": "Tyranitar's high Attack stat coupled with powerful, spammable STAB moves in Stone Edge and Crunch makes it a fearsome wallbreaker. Powerful STAB Pursuit lets Tyranitar also serve as one of OU's most threatening trappers. Tyranitar can use its solid bulk and unique typing to check Pokemon such as Latios, Alolan Marowak, Choice-locked Tapu Lele, and Volcarona. Sand Stream is also noteworthy because it allows Tyranitar to support sand sweepers like Excadrill and Mega Garchomp. Finally, Mega Tyranitar can make use of its added titanic bulk and Speed to set up and sweep with Dragon Dance, as well as check dangerous threats such as BoltBeam Magearna, Kyurem-B, and Heatran. Unfortunately, Tyranitar is let down by its Rock / Dark typing, which leaves it vulnerable to many of OU's common types such as Fighting, Ground, and Water. Its STAB attacks are also not as spammable against Mega Mawile, Magearna, and Landorus-T. Another downfall is that Tyranitar's low Speed causes it to be forced out frequently by faster threats.", "Passimian": "Passimian takes the role of a capable revenge killer in the NU metagame thanks to the combination of its formidable attacking power, good bulk, and relatively high Speed tier, enabling it to fit on a variety of teams. Possessing a great movepool consisting of good coverage options such as Knock Off, Gunk Shot, and Earthquake alongside a pivot move in U-turn lets Passimian break through certain checks depending on what moves it chooses to run. Its Fighting typing allows it to check the majority of Dark-, Ice-, and Steel-types in the tier such as Incineroar, Mega Glalie, and Klinklang, making it a valuable choice on more offensive teams that need a reliable revenge killer for the aforementioned threats. While it has a good Speed tier, it still can be outsped by quite a few offensive Pokemon, such as opposing Choice Scarf users like Scyther, Delphox, and Rotom, alongside Vivillon and Klinklang after a setup boost. Passimian's ability Receiver is rather useless, meaning it has a hard time differentiating itself compared to other Fighting-types such as Hitmonlee, Medicham, and Hariyama due to it solely relying on its moveset and stats to outline itself. It can also be worn down rather quickly due to the lack of reliable recovery, which is further problematic because of its tendency to pivot in repeatedly against common threats such as Incineroar, Sneasel, and Klinklang throughout the match, leading to it being chipped quite easily at times.", "Bidoof": "Bidoof's access to Simple-boosted Swords Dance and Curse may make it seem like a threatening wallbreaker, but its poor bulk and Speed detract from its ability to punch holes. Even though it has access to Quick Attack to make up for its low Speed, it simply isn't strong enough after a Swords Dance to net KOs. Thus, Bidoof finds itself completely outclassed by other Normal-types, such as Zigzagoon, whose access to Belly Drum + Extremespeed makes it a far stronger and threatening sweeper, and Bunnelby, which has a higher Speed stat and Huge Power to work better as a wallbreaker.", "Solgaleo": null, "Munchlax": "Munchlax has a sky-high HP stat and a terrific Special Defense stat, which make it one of the best special walls in the metagame. Its ability Thick Fat allows it to better counter Ice- and Fire-type attackers, and its good Attack stat gives it the ability to hit hard and avoid becoming setup bait while performing its defensive duties. However, Munchlax performs far worse as a special tank in practice than it does on paper. Its low Defense stat means that Munchlax will often be forced out or taken out by physical attacks. The prevalence of Knock Off, including among the special attackers of the metagame, means that too often, Munchlax will lose its item and become crippled in its defensive capabilities early on. Furthermore, Munchlax lacks access to recovery outside of Rest and Berry Juice + Recycle, which leaves it prone to getting worn down throughout a match. Lastly, Munchlax's typing is not ideal for a defensive Pokemon in Little Cup, leaving it with a weakness to the common Fighting-type attacks.", "Pupitar": null, "Nuzleaf": null, "Haxorus": "Haxorus is a solid physical sweeper and wallbreaker in the UU metagame thanks to its superb Attack stat and a powerful STAB move in Outrage, as well as two setup moves in Swords Dance and Dragon Dance. Its typing also grants it good resistances that help it take hits from threats such as Suicune, Rotom-C, and Rotom-H and open up some setup opportunities. Furthermore, a decent physical movepool with coverage such as Earthquake and Poison Jab allows it to go toe-to-toe with Steel- and Fairy-types such as Mega Aggron, Empoleon, and Togekiss, and its ability Mold Breaker helps it to be a stallbreaker, allowing it to set up and bypass the tier's Unaware users in Quagsire and Pyukumuku, stall's normal answers to physical setup sweepers, and giving it an edge over other setup sweepers such as Cobalion. However, Haxorus's Speed tier, while good for outspeeding balance and stall teams, renders it slower than many of UU's faster offensive threats such as Latias, Infernape, and Hydreigon. Its mediocre bulk also hinders it by limiting its ability to set up and leaving it prone to being revenge killed by said faster offensive Pokemon or priority such as Mamoswine's Ice Shard. It faces competition as a Dragon-type from Latias, Hydreigon, and Kommo-o, all of which offer more utility due to their better bulk, better typings, and stronger coverage; Kommo-o also has access to powerful Fighting-type STAB move in Close Combat to give it an edge as a Dragon Dance sweeper.", "Weedle": null, "Shuppet": "Despite Shuppet's high base Attack stat of 75, it becomes hard to use due to its other poor base stats and lack of a strong physical Ghost-type move, its strongest being Shadow Sneak. This limiting movepool also gives it a hard time against Dark-types, which simply shrug off its attacks and can even Pursuit trap it. Other Ghost-types like Frillish and Pumpkaboo-XL simply make better use of their Ghost typing due to their stats and movepool, while physical attackers like Pawniard and Timburr are better due to their higher damage output and bulk.", "Kricketune": "Even with Technician, Kricketune\u2019s lack of any offensive stats prevents it from using this quirk to the fullest. Due to its weakness to Stealth Rock and very poor defenses, Kricketune only functions as a suicide lead on the niche playstyle of Sticky Web, but even there it is outclassed by Smeargle and Shuckle which compress both Sticky Web and Stealth Rock, are faster or bulkier, and have far better support moves like Spore and Encore.", "Miltank": "Miltank serves as a Stealth Rock setter in the NU metagame. What differentiates it from other setters such as Steelix and Rhydon is its access to reliable recovery in Milk Drink, helping it keep Stealth Rock up more reliably in the long run. Furthermore, Miltank's Thick Fat makes it a reliable check to Ice- and Fire-type Pokemon like Mega Glalie, Sneasel, and Delphox. Its naturally solid bulk and good Speed stat mean it can also serve as a reliable answer to the likes of Comfey, Guzzlord and Vikavolt. Miltank's offensive stats and movepool are quite lackluster, though, so it is very passive. Furthermore, Xatu puts a complete stop to Miltank thanks to its Magic Bounce while also chipping it with Rocky Helmet if Miltank uses Seismic Toss.", "Snivy": "Snivy's niche comes from the ability Contrary and the move Leaf Storm, which when paired together give Snivy a 130-Base Power move that also provides a +2 boost to its Special Attack, making it one of the best wallbreakers and the best offensive Grass-type Pokemon in Little Cup. Contrary also has several other uses, including making Snivy one of the best Sticky Web checks in the metagame by giving it a +1 boost to Speed every time it comes in when the entry hazard is up. In addition, Defog lets it support its teammates by clearing entry hazards. However, Snivy's poor offensive movepool forces it to rely on Hidden Power for coverage against the wide variety of Pokemon that resist Leaf Storm. Additionally, Snivy hits 17 Speed, which, while decent, leaves it susceptible to being revenge killed by faster Pokemon; couple this with its mediocre defenses, and its sweeping potential becomes rather limited.", "Machop": "Machop is a decent Choice Scarf user with great utility moves in Knock Off and a 100% accurate Dynamic Punch thanks to No Guard. Dynamic Punch is very spammable due to the guaranteed confusion, as even Pokemon that resist it don't want to switch in and be confused. It's complemented further by great coverage moves, always giving Machop the option to hit what Dynamic Punch doesn't: Knock Off hits Ghost-types, Poison Jab hits Fairy-types, and Rock Slide hits Flying-types. However, Machop is very frail due to its lack of Eviolite and is very reliant on its Choice Scarf, becoming quite slow for its role without the Choice Scarf and losing almost all of its effectiveness. Machop's low bulk allows it to be easily revenge killed and its low base Speed causes it to be outsped by most other Choice Scarf users. Also, some checks to Machop such as Spritzee and Slowpoke don't mind the confusion very much, and the chance to hit oneself in confusion is only one in three. Machop faces competition from other Fighting-types: as a Choice Scarf user, Mienfoo gives it competition because of its better Speed, Regenerator ability, and access to U-turn, and as a bulky attacker, Timburr gives it competition because of its better bulk and access to Mach Punch.", "Spinarak": "Spinarak is blessed with access to the move Sticky Web, which means it can greatly support its teammates, especially offensive ones, by allowing them to outspeed foes they usually wouldn't. However, it is generally outclassed by Surskit, which is a much faster Sticky Web setter. Despite this, Spinarak has several niches that differentiate it from Surskit and allow it to perform effectively in its own right. For instance, it has a better defensive typing and superior bulk, which allows it to check and set up entry hazards against Snivy, a large threat to Sticky Web teams, along with common Fighting- and Fairy-types like Timburr and Spritzee. Insomnia means that Spinarak can switch in and set up hazards versus Foongus with ease. Spinarak has a passable Attack stat and can learn Megahorn, a powerful STAB move, and Leech Life, which provides recovery, and it can also use Toxic Spikes, furthering its supportive role by letting it wear down its foes so that its teammates can KO them more easily. Unfortunately, Spinarak also has significant downsides; its poor bulk combined with its low Speed stat means that it struggles to fulfill its role as a Sticky Web setter effectively. While its typing allows it to check some common Pokemon, it makes it weak to Stealth Rock and Flying-types, some of which can also remove its entry hazards using Defog. Spinarak also has extremely limited versatility, as its utility stems almost purely from its access to Sticky Web, making it very predictable. Sticky Web can be easily removed by Pokemon such as Staryu, Drilbur, Vullaby, and Archen using Rapid Spin or Defog, limiting Spinarak's contribution to the battle; Vullaby and Archen are the most notable because of their super effective STAB moves that they can use against Spinarak. Sticky Web is further flawed in that Pawniard and Snivy, two very common threats, can switch in and benefit from it via Defiant and Contrary, respectively.", "Froakie": null, "Cacnea": "Being able to reach an impressive 19 Attack and having access to both Swords Dance and Sucker Punch help Cacnea carve out a nice spot as a niche offensive attacker. Cacnea is limited in that it is not very bulky even with Eviolite help, and its greatest asset, Sucker Punch, is also its greatest hindrance in that Cacnea relies heavily on it to be of any use because of its lackluster Speed stat.", "Simipour": "Simipour carves itself a niche in PU by being a fast Water-type with immediate offensive pressure thanks to its high Speed, good Special Attack, ability to boost with Nasty Plot, and unresisted coverage in one moveset. However, Simipour is very frail, so it rarely gets the opportunity to set up. Additionally, Simipour may have a good Speed tier, but it is still prone to being revenge killed by faster threats such as Scyther, Lycanroc, and Alolan Raichu. Simipour faces stiff competition as a Nasty Plot sweeper from the likes of Alolan Raichu, Jynx, and Simisear. Alolan Raichu is faster, while Jynx's Substitute and Lovely Kiss give it more opportunities to set up. Simisear virtually does the same thing that Simipour does except it has a better matchup against Grass-types such as Lilligant, Bellossom, and Roselia, while the entire tier has a difficult time switching directly into it. However, Simipour is not weak to Stealth Rock and has a much easier time setting up against Pokemon like Regirock, Aggron, and Mudsdale on forced switches. Simipour also has to compete with its fellow Water-types such as Jellicent, Omastar, and Floatzel. Jellicent is immediately stronger, is bulkier, has access to Trick, has dual STAB, and can spinblock; Omastar is a better late-game sweeper with Shell Smash and can set up entry hazards; Floatzel is faster, has Aqua Jet, and can bluff a physical set.", "Cranidos": "In terms of raw power, Cranidos is in a class of its own. Its incredible base 125 Attack is unmatched in LC, and its two great abilities in Mold Breaker and Sheer Force only increase its offensive presence. The former lets it bypass abilities like Sturdy and Levitate, and the latter effectively gives a Life Orb boost to moves that have secondary effects at the cost of those effects. It has the movepool to use its excellent Attack stat, with its Rock-type STAB attacks backed up with options like Zen Headbutt, Superpower, Crunch, Fire Punch, Thunder Punch, and Earthquake. This means that Cranidos has very few safe switch-ins. Cranidos's Rock typing also lets it check Flying-types like Vullaby.", "Dewgong": "Dewgong is completely outclassed as a bulky Water-type by Pokemon like Quagsire, Lanturn, and Jellicent due to their better typing and lack of Stealth Rock weakness. Quagsire and Jellicent also have reliable recovery, and all the have more valuable utility options such as Unaware for Quagsire, Taunt and Will-O-Wisp for Jellicent, and Heal Bell for Lanturn. Dewgong's awful defensive typing also makes it extremely passive, so it can't even utilize its niche to the fullest extent; While it can be used on stall as a Perish trapper, Pyukumuku has a more valuable role on stall as a trapper with Block that can wear down opposing Pokemon with Toxic, punish setup sweepers with Unaware, and use reliable recovery in Recover.", "Kecleon": "Due to its high special bulk and unique offensive attributes, Kecleon can make a good user of Assault Vest, able to check a majority of special attackers in the tier, including Mesprit, Pyroar, and Oricorio-G. Its Dark / Fighting coverage between Knock Off and Drain Punch can be tricky to switch into, especially with Protean giving Kecleon STAB for every move. Furthermore, Kecleon has useful priority in Shadow Sneak that can let it revenge kill threats like Jynx and Oricorio-G, and it also has access to Sucker Punch. Protean can make Kecleon difficult to play around because it can change its typing to resist or become immune to the opposing Pokemon's attacks, such as clicking Shadow Sneak in front of a Fighting-type. Unfortunately, poor physical bulk and awful Speed make Kecleon easily taken out by physical attackers like Kangaskhan and Absol. Additionally, Kecleon struggles greatly with status, and due to its only moderate Attack stat, it is easy to wall with bulkier Pokemon like Weezing and Gastrodon. While Kecleon may face competition with other Assault Vest tanks like Eelektross and Hitmonchan which offer better role compression, its unique priority and Protean coverage give it a niche.", "Shiftry": "Shiftry is an offensive force to be reckoned with as a result of its solid offensive typing, decent mixed attacking stats, and strong STAB options such as Knock Off, Leaf Storm, Seed Bomb, and Sucker Punch. Because of its mixed coverage, Shiftry manages to stand apart from other Dark- and Grass-types in the tier and is a massive threat to teams that are overly reliant on Pokemon such as Aggron, Mawile, and Regirock to check physical attackers. Shiftry becomes even more threatening under sun because of its ability Chlorophyll doubling its Speed, which allows it to also threaten opposing sun teams. It can also function well as an offensive user of Defog because its typing gives it the ability to threaten common entry hazard setters such as Golem, Golurk and Regirock, allowing it to clear the field of entry hazards on the turn that they switch out. However, its great offensive typing curses it with weaknesses to common attack typings such as Fire, Flying, Poison, and Ice, and its poor bulk doesn't make matters much better. Although its Speed is far from terrible, Shiftry is outsped by common offensive Pokemon such as Jynx and Pyroar, and its main method of mitigating this in Sucker Punch isn't very reliable due to how it can be taken advantage of. Finally, as a purely physical wallbreaker, Shiftry faces competition from other Dark-types in the tier such as Absol and Alolan Raticate, both of which, while slower, are stronger.", "Cryogonal": "Cryogonal is one of the tier's premier Rapid Spin users and better specially defensive walls. Its Levitate ability allows it to come in safely on all entry hazards except Stealth Rock, while access to Recover gives it longevity. Its sky-high Special Defense allows it to reliably check a multitude of special attackers, including Palossand, Vikavolt, Vivillon, and Whimsicott. Unfortunately, its Ice typing gives it a weakness to Stealth Rock, making it lose 25% of its health every time it switches into the entry hazard and forcing it to use Recover more often. Cryogonal's low Defense stat also makes it vulnerable to Pursuit trapping and any non-resisted physical attacks; this further hinders its capacity to remove entry hazards, as common entry hazard setters like Garbodor, Steelix, and Rhydon can hit it hard with their physical attacks.", "Ludicolo": "Ludicolo is a fearsome sweeper in the PU metagame by virtue of its access to Swift Swim, which allows it to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame under rain. Furthermore, a decent Special Attack stat in tandem with a good STAB combination and nearly unresisted coverage allows it to adequately pressure offensive and defensive teams alike, and a fairly decent defensive typing and good special bulk allow it to tank some hits and find easy opportunities to set up on Pokemon like Floatzel and Lanturn. Unfortunately, Ludicolo is hindered by its poor Defense and Speed stats, as they can complicate setup and leave it susceptible to common threats in Skuntank, Primeape, and Togedemaru. It also suffers from the prevalence of Pokemon that can tank a hit in the rain and cripple or KO it in return, including Ferroseed, Swanna, and Assault Vest Hitmonchan. Lastly, Ludicolo's physical frailty can leave it prone to getting revenge killed by strong priority users, including Absol, Alolan Raticate, and especially Kangaskhan, which can stall out rain turns with Fake Out.", "Rhyhorn": "Despite its great HP, Attack, and Defense, Rhyhorn is outclassed by Rock-types such as Onix and Tirtouga, as they have better bulk and access to decent utility options, which Rhyhorn lacks. Rhyhorn's poor Special Defense and Speed in tandem with its common weaknesses mean that many special attackers are able to outspeed and easily KO it, which worsens Rhyhorn's defensive presence. The presence of Onix, a check to Flying-types with higher Speed and better abilities and Pawniard, a better offensive Stealth Rock setter that checks Flying-types, makes it hard to justify using Rhyhorn on any serious team.", "Torchic": null, "Regice": "Regice is a threatening sweeper due to its access to Rock Polish and good coverage moves, as well as the tier's lack of good Ice-resistant Pokemon. Its amazing special bulk makes it a good offensive check to Pokemon like Lilligant, Rotom-F, and Mesprit. Regice is also able to utilize All-Out Pummeling in order to break some of its traditional checks, such as Hitmonchan, with some chip damage. However, Regice has a crippling defensive typing and poor Defense, leaving it vulnerable to all forms of entry hazards and physical attackers. It also has a hard time setting up due to this. Regice's Special Attack stat is subpar, and it needs a decent amount of chip damage on most of the Pokemon in the tier in order to sweep. Finally, even at +2, Regice cannot outspeed many common Choice Scarf users like Primeape and Togedemaru due to its lackluster Speed, although the latter requires prior damage to OHKO it.", "Armaldo": "While a sky-high Attack stat and access to Rapid Spin give Armaldo the facade of being a viable offensive spinner, it's completely outclassed. Its horrendous typing gives it few useful resistances and weaknesses to common types like Water and Rock, which also makes it weak to Stealth Rock on top of being vulnerable to every other entry hazard. This, combined with its very low Speed stat, makes it hard for Armaldo to remove entry hazards as consistently as other spinners, as it'll often be taking a lot of damage in the process. It also can't remove entry hazards against common setters like Aggron and Regirock. All of these facts combined make it mostly outclassed by other offensive entry hazard removers such as Hitmonchan, Skuntank, and Alolan Sandslash.", "Espeon": "Espeon is a wallbreaker capable of punching holes into most balance builds, boasting great power when running Calm Mind or Choice Specs to overcome checks such as Bronzong and Mandibuzz. Nice coverage, a good Speed tier, a high Special Attack stat, and access to recovery in Morning Sun are some of the traits Espeon has to offer. Without a doubt, though, the flashiest aspect of Espeon comes from its ability Magic Bounce, which sends back any status moves and hazards to its user. However, Espeon's high Speed and Special Attack are obfuscated by its mediocre bulk, being only able to take very few special hits. Morning Sun also is a move with abysmal PP, which can be detrimental when Espeon attempts to set up. Despite having good ways to deal with Ghost- and Dark-types, it is still frail and very susceptible to Pursuit trapping. Due to not being able to switch into a lot of hits, Espeon usually needs pivoting to work properly.", "Gumshoos": "Although it has access to U-turn and can use Stakeout to take advantage of forced switches and become a decently strong wallbreaker, there is very little reason to consider using Gumshoos over other, much more consistent Normal-types such as Stoutland and Kangaskhan. Aside from the competition Gumshoos faces as a Normal-type wallbreaker, it is also held back by its low Speed and mediocre defenses, as they limit its wallbreaking capabilities and make it rather easy to revenge kill.", "Cubone": "Cubone is one of the hardest hitters in Little Cup thanks to its Thick Club-doubled Attack. It also has a unique and powerful STAB attack in Bonemerang, which hits twice and thus can break Focus Sash and Sturdy. Combine that with its great physical bulk and good coverage options in Knock Off and Rock Slide, and you've got one powerful wallbreaker. Unfortunately, Cubone is really easy to take advantage of due to its poor Speed and special bulk, therefore requiring a lot of support from teammates to effectively sweep. It also faces competition from Mudbray, which isn't as strong as Cubone but is faster and bulkier. Lastly, Cubone is extremely vulnerable to Knock Off due to its reliance on Thick Club to deal any sufficient damage.", "Ferroseed": "Ferroseed boasts itself as a very adept entry hazard setter thanks to its great bulk, Eviolite, and an amazing defensive typing that allows it to resist common Grass-, Fairy-, Electric-, and Water-type moves from Pokemon such as Whimsicott, Heliolisk, and Samurott. Thanks to its defensive typing, Ferroseed finds many opportunities to set up entry hazards such as Stealth Rock and Spikes. Aside from entry hazard setting moves, Ferroseed has access to a great utility movepool consisting of Leech Seed, Gyro Ball, and Protect, which perform different roles such as stalling out foes and dealing adequate damage. However, Ferroseed's defensive typing leaves it vulnerable to Fire- and Fighting-type Pokemon such as Incineroar and Hariyama as well as coverage moves from Slowking and Silvally-Steel. Ferroseed's lackluster offensive capabilities makes it setup bait to setup sweepers such as Braviary and Klinklang, especially if they have Substitute to protect themselves from Ferroseed's utility moves and Gyro Ball.", "Flabebe": null, "Shedinja": "Shedinja's unique ability in Wonder Guard allows it to potentially become a deadly late-game wincon, as it's able to completely wall threats such as Mesprit, Alolan Raichu, and Hitmonchan lacking Stone Edge. However, being stuck with only 1 HP nullifies any sort of defensive utility Shedinja could have for itself and makes it instantly fall to the ubiquitous users of entry hazards, Toxic and Will-O-Wisp, Leech Seed, and Snow Warning. Wonder Guard also does nothing against common attacking types such as Rock, Flying, and Dark, as well as Pursuit from the likes of Skuntank and Stoutland. All of this means Shedinja requires strenuous team support to function, which ultimately makes it a liability for most teams. Furthermore, Shedinja faces severe competition with Scyther as a setup sweeper, as it has superior stats across the board, reliable recovery, and the ability to pivot with U-turn.", "Wishiwashi": "Wishiwashi has the highest Special Attack stat in the tier, allowing it to 2HKO most Pokemon with its Choice Specs-boosted moves. Given its low Speed stat, great offensive capabilities, and the fact that it functions optimally with HP investment to avoid deactivating its School form, it works best with Trick Room support. While it has a shallow movepool, it has enough coverage to make it difficult to wall with standard Water-resistant Pokemon, as Hidden Power Grass 2HKOes Poliwrath and Silvally-Water, U-turn OHKOes Jynx, and Ice Beam provides coverage against Grass-types like Cradily that are able to switch into a Choice Specs-boosted Hydro Pump. Its vulnerability to entry hazards coupled with its lack of reliable recovery options outside of Rest and Leftovers leaves it liable to being worn down to the point its ability Schooling is deactivated, which in turn causes Wishiwashi to become extremely passive. Even with full HP investment and high defenses, it is unable to take many neutral hits before it's forced out of School forme. Outside of Trick Room, Wishiwashi is very easy to KO or deactivate Schooling, as it's slow, forcing it to take a hit before attacking. Its weakness to common typings in Grass and Electric causes it to lose to Pokemon like Lilligant and Alolan Raichu when Trick Room is not active. Wishiwashi requires a great deal of team support to work well, as it cannot set up Trick Room on its own and greatly benefits from entry hazard removal.", "Samurott": "Samurott is one of the best offensive Water-types in the NU tier. Thanks to its balanced attacking stats, it can effectively run physical, special, and mixed sets. Having access to near-perfect coverage with moves like Hydro Pump, Ice Beam, and Grass Knot, it rarely finds itself hard walled by any Pokemon. It also has access to Swords Dance and Aqua Jet, allowing it to perform as a sweeper, as well as another utility move in Taunt, which can give it the opportunity to break through Pokemon like Vaporeon and defensive Slowking by preventing them from recovering. It can also prevent status moves from the likes of Mega Audino and Stealth Rock from Pokemon like Druddigon. Samurott has quite a few checks, however, such as Heliolisk and Vaporeon, both of which tank Water-type moves with ease, preventing Samurott from spamming Hydro Pump and Liquidation. Heliolisk works especially well against Samurott, as it is faster and puts a stop to both the special and Swords Dance sets. Samurott is further hindered by its mediocre Speed, meaning you'll have to keep it healthy so it can set up and sweep. This also makes it easy to revenge kill with Pokemon that are resistant to Aqua Jet, such as Sceptile and Whimsicott.", "Sneasel": "Sneasel is one the most dominant Pokemon in NU thanks to its fearsome combination of power, speed, and a spectacular offensive typing. With access to a powerful STAB move in Knock Off, Sneasel can devastate defensive and offensive teams alike. Furthermore, Sneasel is a fantastic Pursuit trapper and can remove dangerous Pokemon such as Sigilyph, Mismagius, Delphox, and Slowking for the rest of its team to take advantage of. Sneasel can fit on any team archetype with the appropriate support and almost always pulls its weight. However, while good offensively, Sneasel's poor defensive typing and low bulk mean it cannot switch into or withstand many attacks, making it more difficult to effectively Pursuit trap bulkier foes. It is also extremely vulnerable to the most powerful offensive Pokemon in the tier, Incineroar, as Sneasel has little to touch it with outside of the rare Low Kick.", "Ledyba": "Although it has a good movepool and a 4x resistance to the common Fighting type, Ledyba is unviable in Little Cup due to its poor defensive and offensive stats and undesirable weakness to Stealth Rock, which massively offset the benefit of its Fighting resistance. Ledyba is outclassed by Venonat as a Baton Passer user except for Ledyba's Rattled ability, and it's worth noting that Baton Pass is a less viable strategy.", "Hitmontop": "Hitmontop offers a very niche combination of Rapid Spin and Foresight to clear entry hazards against Ghost-type Pokemon and is a reliable check to Dark-type Pokemon such as Incineroar and Sneasel. Outside of this niche, however, other hazard removers and Fighting-type Pokemon offer much more utility or power. Hitmontop's exploitable weaknesses, lack of reliable recovery, and only good bulk mean that it gets worn down incredibly quickly without Wish support, leaving it very easily taken advantage of. It also relies on only Fighting-type STAB attacks and Toxic for damage, so it is easily walled by Fighting-resistant and Poison-immune Pokemon such as Vileplume, Garbodor, and Golbat. This means that Hitmontop only finds a secure niche on stall teams that need a decent Incineroar check and entry hazard control.", "Kingdra": "Kingdra's decent Speed stat in combination with Swift Swim allows it to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame, as well as most Choice Scarf users, when in the rain. This combined with a decent Special Attack stat makes it a top Swift Swim user in the metagame. Kingdra's access to a powerful secondary STAB move in Draco Meteor is a blessing, giving it the means to pressure or KO Pokemon that annoy rain teams such as Mega Venusaur and Mega Latias. Kingdra's Dragon / Water typing is also useful for checking Ash-Greninja as it is a rain attacker that isn't prone to Water Shuriken. Unfortunately, bulky Water- and Grass-types such as Toxapex, Ferrothorn, and Assault Vest Tangrowth are some of the most common defensive Pokemon in OU, meaning that Kingdra will have trouble sweeping most teams. Kingdra is also heavily dependent on rain in order to be effective, as it is relatively weak and slow for an offensive Pokemon outside of it."}
